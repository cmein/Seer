<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- South Korea's Ji Dong-Won grabbed a dramatic injury-time winner as Sunderland stunned English Premier League leaders Manchester City 1-0 at the Stadium of Light Sunday.</p>
<p>The upset result left City ahead of champions Manchester United on goal difference, having gone into the match hoping to open up a three-point lead after their neighbors were beaten 3-2 by Blackburn 24 hours earlier.</p>
<p>Instead, Roberto Mancini's men were left to reflect on a wasted opportunity with cavalier defending in the dying moments costing them even a point.</p>
<p>Sunderland, who had been penned in their area for much of the final few minutes, broke upfield and had a two-man advantage as Stephane Sessegnon played in Ji.</p>

<p>On as a substitute for Niklas Bendtner, he beat England goalkeeper Joe Hart with a composed finish.</p>
<p>Moments before City substitute Micah Richards had thumped the crossbar after Simon Mignolet parried a David Silva shot.</p>
<p>Edin Dzeko hit the woodwork in the first half as the leaders dominated possession, but the home side also had clear-cut chances.</p>
<p>Bendtner wasted his before the break and Sessegnon screwed his effort wide in the second half.</p>
<p>The three points lifted Sunderland, who have been revived under new manager Martin O'Neill, to 13th place, six points clear of the drop zone.</p>
<p>City must now entertain Liverpool on Tuesday night as they look to get their title challenge back on firmer footing.</p>
<p>It completed a weekend of upsets with none of the top five, bar Arsenal, winning.</p>
<p>Tottenham stayed in third, six points behind the Manchester pair with a game in hand, after being held at Swansea.</p>
<p>In Sunday's other game, Nigerian international <strong>Victor Anichebe</strong> came off the bench to score the only goal of the game in Everton's 1-0 win away to West Bromwich Albion.</p>
