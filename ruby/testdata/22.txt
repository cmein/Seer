<p>&ldquo;Her nicknames are Diva, Spa Princess and Ditzy,&rdquo; <strong>Currie Lee</strong> giggles, gazing adoringly at the stocky <strong>French bulldog </strong>before her.</p>
<p><strong>Victoria </strong>&ndash; her real name &ndash; blinks her <strong>big droopy eyes </strong>in response before plopping haughtily to the floor, legs askew.</p>
<p>We are gathered at Currie&rsquo;s <strong>798 studio boutique D-SATA.DIVA</strong> for her weekly canine behavior training session with Dennis Schenk, a man she calls &ldquo;<strong>Beijing&rsquo;s dog whisperer</strong>.&rdquo; Joining us for the afternoon are her mother and her pug Celli, as well as her best friend (and founder of locally based e-commerce site Luxbible.com) Miao Lu and her pug Qia.</p>
