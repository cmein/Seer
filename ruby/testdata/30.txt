<p><strong>Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)</strong> -- Rick Santorum started the new year riding the wave of a strong finish in the last major poll before Tuesday's Iowa caucuses and looked to rally his supporters in a series of events on Sunday.</p>
<p>There were few surprises in Saturday night's Des Moines Register poll -- front-runners Mitt Romney and Ron Paul finished 1-2 as they had in other polls during the week. But the Register poll showed Santorum, who just weeks ago had registered only in single digits, pulling ahead of rivals Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry.</p>
<p>The Register also pointed out that if only the last two days of the four-day poll were considered, Santorum would be ahead of Paul in second place.</p>
<p>Santorum's rise is the latest in a campaign-long series of votes testing conservative candidates against Romney, who is favored by establishment Republicans and has finished at the top or in the top tier in most polls since he announced his candidacy in June.</p>
<p>Santorum says he knew his turn would come.</p>
<p>"People have asked me, 'When are you going to get your surge? You're not going anywhere. Your message must not be resonating,'" the former Pennsylvania senator said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."</p>
<p>"I said my surge is going to come on January 3rd after the people of Iowa do what they do, which is actually analyze the candidates, figure out where their positions are, find out who's the right leader, who's got what it takes to defeat Barack Obama and to lead this country, and I've always relied that when that crunch time comes, in these last two weeks, that's when we were going to start to pick up, and that's exactly what happened," he said.</p>
<p>While Santorum is benefiting from the buzz of the poll results, another figure speaks to the prolonged test drive of conservative anti-Romney candidates -- 41% of those surveyed in the Register poll say they could still change their minds about their choice.</p>
<p>The fact that Iowans were still undecided didn't surprise one of the state's top Republicans, Rep. Steve King, but, "I am a little surprised that that number seems to be going up, if I'm seeing the same polls, instead of down, creeping up. And I'm going to make this point, too, that encourage your people everywhere, especially, and to come out to the caucus. Going there undecided is just fine. You'll be in good company with lots of Iowans going to the caucuses undecided," he said on CNN's "State of the Union" with Candy Crowley.</p>
<p>King told Crowley that he, too, wasn't yet decided on a choice, which is a much-coveted endorsement in Iowa.</p>
<p>"If that instant comes that I'm convinced that one will do a significant better job than another, I won't hesitate, I'll step in," King said. "But it has to be a conviction on my part. I don't think I'd be doing justice to this privilege that I have if it were not a conviction."</p>
<p>The Register poll showed Romney with 24% and Paul at 22%. Santorum was at 15%, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich stood at 12% and Texas Gov. Rick Perry was at 11%.</p>
<p>Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann was at 7% and former Utah governor and ambassador to China Jon Huntsman isn't competing in the state, instead concentrating on New Hampshire, which votes a week later.</p>
<p>As Santorum has passed him in polls, Perry, once a front-runner before a series of stumbles sent his poll numbers plummeting, has steadily criticized Santorum's record on spending votes when he was in the Senate as he's tried to draw contrasts between himself and Santorum. He continued those attacks Sunday.</p>
<p>"Well, there are a lot of differences between myself and Rick Santorum, as Michele (Bachmann) talked about he's got a spending problem, he's got an earmark problem," Perry said on "Fox News Sunday." "I'm going to let him explain to people, why did you vote to raise the debt ceiling, vote for the 'Bridge to Nowhere,' Montana sheep institute?" Perry said, referring to highly publicized examples of legislators' pet projects buried in appropriations bills. "You're telling us you're a fiscal conservative?"</p>
<p>Santorum has defended his record, saying that such horse-trading was how Congress did business when he was in the Senate and that he supported subsequent reform efforts after he left Washington.</p>
