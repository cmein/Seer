Thank you to CNN Baghdad producer Jomana Karadsheh for sending me these pictures of the Iraqi national football team.<br /><br /><div><div><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://www.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/middle.east/blog/uploaded_images/jomanateam-753722.JPG" border="0" /><br /><p><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://www.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/middle.east/blog/uploaded_images/jomanastadium-718588.JPG" border="0" />The players are training in Baghdad for the first time in four years. I remember being in Baghdad when they wowed the world with their amazing performance at the Asian Cup, uniting the country in a national pride no political initiative seems to achieve.</p><p><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://www.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/middle.east/blog/uploaded_images/jamanafans2-729211.JPG" border="0" /><br /><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://www.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/middle.east/blog/uploaded_images/jomanakids-748753.JPG" border="0" /> Jomana writes that the fans who come to the stadium everyday are local children from the nearby Sadr city slum area. They see these players as their heroes.</p><p><img style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://www.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/middle.east/blog/uploaded_images/jomanacars-707618.JPG" border="0" />But the horrors of Iraq's bloody war are always present: right outside the training area, the carcasses of cars destroyed in explosions over the years pepper the perimeter outside stadium. </p></div></div>
