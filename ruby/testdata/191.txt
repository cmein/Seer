<p class="pullout"><br/><span class="line">Joel Klein declared only a handful of snow days in his 8 1/2-year reign as New York City schools chancellor. Yesterday, he said one of them was to make good on a promise he made to Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg’s son, Jack. . . . “I understand you’re running the schools in New York City,” Klein said the boy told him, then added, “I want to know one thing. Do you declare snow days? . . . Will you declare a snow day on my birthday?”. . . Although the boy was in a private school, Klein told us that even at his tender age, “he knew that a snow day for the public schools meant a snow day for the private schools” as well. . . . But it would be Jack’s mother who called in the favor. On a day when it was “really snowing bad,” Klein said Caroline phoned him and said, “It’s not [Jack’s] birthday, but he’s got a paper due tomorrow. A snow day would be awfully rich right now.” He added that one of the “snow days I declared was that.”<span class="break"><br/></span></span><span class="line">—<em>The News</em>.<span class="break"><br/></span></span><br/></p>
