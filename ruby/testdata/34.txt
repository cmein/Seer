<p>Twelve new suspected arson fires broke out early today in the Los Angeles area as police officials acknowledged they finally have a person of interest in the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/fires-set-years-eve-la-serial-arson-attacks/story?id=15268683" target="external">spree of blazes that has engulfed the city since Dec. 30</a>.</p>
<p>"We currently have a person of interest that they [detectives] are interviewing," Capt. Jaime Moore, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman said today on "<a href="http://gma.yahoo.com" target="external">Good Morning America</a>."</p>
<p>Police Sunday distributed DVDs of a 20- to 30-year-old white male caught on surveillance video Saturday leaving an underground parking structure on Hollywood Boulevard where a car fire was reported.</p>
<p>Officials asked for the public's help in identifying the man, now wanted for questioning in connection with the 55 fires that have been set since Thursday.</p>
<p>Detectives estimated the man, who has a receding hairline and is seen in the video wearing a bulky jacket, is between 5-foot-6 and 6-foot-1.</p>
<p>Police Sunday also acknowledged they know of at least two other people who might be involved in the fires. Capt. Moore declined to say whether the person detectives are interviewing is the same man seen on the surveillance video.</p>
<p>"It's still too early to speculate whether or not this is the same person," he told "GMA." "It's always a possibility that it could be just one individual, but we also have to look at the possibility of this being the work of more than one."</p>

<p>According to the Associated Press, detectives also served a search warrant at a home in the San Fernando Valley. Several interviews were conducted, but no arrests were made.</p>
<p>The fires have remained clustered in the areas of Hollywood and North Hollywood but, overnight, the arsons expanded to the San Fernando Valley. Capt. Moore confirmed today that 10 of the fires set overnight Sunday were in Los Angeles, while two were in West Hollywood.</p>
<p>"The commonality in a lot of these fires is we have automobile fires that are intentionally set underneath carports or parking structures or adjacent to apartments where people are actually residing," he said.</p>
<p>Police have not yet released details on how the car fires were sparked or what information they have collected at the scenes as they continue to search for suspects.</p>
<p>"Our arson investigators are looking at all the fire scenes and doing everything they can to gather as much evidence as they can," Capt. Moore said. "If this is the work of more than one individual, they can ensure those other individuals don't get away."</p>
<p>"In the last two days, we've seen that as day break comes, we start finding more clues and more evidence because there are fires that didn't quite take off as were intended by this individual or these individuals," he said.</p>
<p>In nearly every case, the fires were set overnight. So far, there have been no injuries as a result of the fires.</p>
<p>Law enforcement sources in LA County told <a href="http://abcnews.go.com" target="external">ABC News</a> that the police and the fire department have built a unified task force coordinated by LAPD in anticipation of a long-term operation, should that be necessary.</p>
<p>"We are creating an 'org' chart with sustained 'ops' and multiple operational periods," one official involved in planning said. The joint fire police task force is employing surveillance cameras and using air support.</p>
<p>Officials are also offering a $60,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. Anyone with information is urged to call 911.</p>
