<p>Danica McKellar is best known for her role as Winnie Cooper in the 1980&#039;s American television series &#034;The Wonder Years&#034;, and as Elsie Snuffin in &#034;The West Wing&#034;.</p>
<p>But what many people don&#039;t know about this actress is that she is also a maths genius.</p>
<p>Her path to becoming an acclaimed mathematician began when she took a hiatus from acting after &#034;The Wonder Years&#034;.</p>
<p>She turned her attention to her studies and ended up graduating from UCLA with a rare high distinction after proving a new math theorem, the Chayes-McKellar-Winn Theorem.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Danica had struggled with maths in her early years but discovered her difficulties were caused by fear of the subject.</p>
<p>She realised she could help other students overcome their phobia of maths so in 2007, wrote her first book &#034;Maths Doesn&#039;t Suck&#034; which quickly became a best-seller in the United States.</p>
<p>It was the first of a series of books Danica has written to help young girls have fun with maths and realise that it is &#034;cool&#034; to be smart.</p>
