<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- Singer Etta James is off the respirator and breathing on her own, but remains in a Southern California hospital, her son said early Monday.</p>
<p>The "At Last" singer is battling the final stages of terminal leukemia and suffering from dementia.</p>
<p>James, 73, was hospitalized on December 21 at the request of her two court-appointed doctors, according to her son, Donto James.</p>
<p>"She's all right. My brother and I would like to see her stay in the hospital a little longer until she gets more stable. Our main concern is for her to be taken care of right," said Donto, who played drums in his mother's Roots band for 15 years.</p>
<p>The singer is conscious, and spent New Year's Eve watching the ball drop with her sons in her hospital room, James said.</p>
