<p>Tactical teams searched Mount Rainier National Park's snowy terrain for an armed gunman suspected of killing a park ranger. Other officers used the cover of darkness early Monday to evacuate dozens of tourists who had been kept for their safety at a visitors center.</p>
<p>About 150 officers converged on the mountain park after ranger Margaret Anderson was shot to death Sunday morning, and searchers used an aircraft with heat-sensing capabilities to hunt from the skies.</p>
<p>Authorities believe the gunman was still in the woods, with weapons.</p>
<p>Pierce County Sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said that Benjamin Colton Barnes, a 24-year-old believed to have survivalist skills, was a "strong person of interest" in the slaying.</p>
<p>"We do have a very hot and dangerous situation," Troyer said.</p>
<p>Safety concerns prompted authorities to keep about 125 tourists quarantined at a visitors center as the manhunt unfolded.</p>
<p>But early Monday morning, officers began escorting them in their cars out of the park.</p>
<p>Crews had initially planned to keep everyone in a basement with guards. But Troyer said it was determined to be "better to do it (evacuate) under the cover of darkness than daylight."</p>
<p>All the visitors were expected to be out by 4 a.m.</p>

<p>Evacuee Dinh Jackson, a mother from Olympia, Wash., who came to the mountain to sled with family and friends, told The Associated Press that officials ordered people to hurry into the lodge after the shooting.</p>
<p>Jackson said officials had everyone get on their knees and place hands behind their heads as they went through the building, looking at faces to make sure the gunman was not among them.</p>
<p>"That was scary for the kids," she said.</p>
<p>Michael Wall, an elementary school teacher from Puyallup, Wash., spent the morning hiking with his son. They didn't find out about the violence until returning.</p>
<p>Wall said he was impressed by how staff members and visitors kept each other comfortable with food and conversation.</p>
<p>"It was calm, cool, easygoing," Wall said. "I didn't notice any tenseness or terseness."</p>
<p>A parks spokesman said Barnes was an Iraq war veteran, and the mother of his child had alleged he suffered from post-traumatic stress following his deployments.</p>
<p>Barnes was involved in a custody dispute in Tacoma in July 2011, during which the toddler's mother sought a temporary restraining order against him, according to court documents. In an affidavit, the woman wrote that Barnes was suicidal and possibly suffered from PTSD after deploying to Iraq in 2007-2008. She said he gets easily irritated, angry and depressed and keeps an arsenal of weapons in his home.</p>
<p>Barnes was also a suspect in the early Sunday morning shooting of four people at a house party south of Seattle, police said.</p>
<p>Sgt. Cindi West, King County Sheriff's spokesperson, said late Sunday that Barnes was connected to an early-morning shooting at a New Year's house party in Skyway, Wash., south of Seattle that left four people injured, two critically. That incident happened about 3 a.m., and stemmed from an argument over a gun.</p>
<p>West said three people fled the scene. Two were located, and West said authorities were trying to find Barnes and had been in contact with his family, trying to have them convince him to "come to the police and tell his side of the story" in the Skyway shooting.</p>
