<p>’Tis the season to announce seasonal schools. Geoff Pullum announced a <a title="Permanent link to Short course on grammar for language technologists" rel="bookmark" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3656">short course on grammar for language technologists</a> as part of a winter school in<strong> </strong><span>Tarragona next month, and Mark Liberman announced a call for course proposals for the LSA's</span><span> <a href="http://lsa2013.lsa.umich.edu/">Linguistic Institute</a> in summer 2013.</span> But what if you can't make it to Tarragona next month, and can't wait a year and a half to get your seasonal school fix? Well, I have <a href="http://nasslli2012.com/">just the school for you</a>!<br />

<p>Yes, the<a href="http://nasslli2012.com/"> North American Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (NASSLLI)</a>, which will be held June 18-22 at UT Austin. In my admittedly biased opinion (I am the school's stressed but excited director) will be totally and amazingly intellectually intense and fantastic:</p>
<ul>
<li>18 graduate level courses + 3 conferences/workshops&#8230; and yet more TBA;</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary mixture of highly nutritious linguistics, computer science, logic, philosophy, and psychology;</li>
<li>Courses and workshops not only from Language Log's own <span style="color: #0000ff;">Chris Potts</span> (Extracting Social Meaning and Sentiment), but also from: <span style="color: #0000ff;">Johan van Benthem</span> (Logical Dynamics), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Craige Roberts</span> (Questions in Discourse), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Noah Goodman</span> (Stochastic Lambda Calculus), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Mark Steedman</span> (Combinatory Categorial Grammar), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Catherine Legg</span> (Possible Worlds), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Adam Lopez</span> (Statistical Machine Translation), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Eric Pacuit</span> (Social Choice Theory), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Valeria de Paiva</span> &amp; <span style="color: #0000ff;">Ulrik Buchholtz</span> (Category Theory), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Adam Pease</span> (Ontology Development), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Ede Zimmermann</span> (Intensionality), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Thomas Icard</span> (Surface Reasoning), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Nina Gierasimczuk</span> (Belief Revision Meets Formal Learning Theory), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Jonathan Ginzburg</span> &amp; <span style="color: #0000ff;">Robin Cooper</span> (Type Theory for Natural Language Semantics),<span style="color: #0000ff;"> Jeroen Groenendijk</span> &amp; <span style="color: #0000ff;">Floris Roelofsen</span> (Inquisitive Semantics), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Shalom Lappin</span> (Computational Semantics), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Tandy Warnow</span> (Phylogenetic Trees), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Hans Kamp</span> &amp; <span style="color: #0000ff;">Mark Sainsbury</span> (Vagueness and Context), <span style="color: #0000ff;">Steve Wechsler</span> &amp; <span style="color: #0000ff;">Eric McCready</span> (Indexicality and Expressives);</li>
<li>Students choose up to five courses, each running 5 days * 90 mins, and get free conference registration into the bargain;</li>
<li>A special Turing Symposium will commemorate the centenary of Turing's birth (hence the cool steampunk Turing Machine on our <a href="http://nasslli2012.com/poster/nasslli-poster-11x17.pdf">poster</a>) on Sat june 23, and will include talks from mathematician Martin Davis and computational linguist/cryptanalyst Kevin Knight;</li>
<li>$195 academic rate for all 5 days, and cheap dorm accommodation available, but if you can't afford that&#8230;</li>
<li>This being the season of giving, we are giving away 50 student scholarships, to include not only the registration fees, and accommodation, but also $$$ towards your travel costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can sign up for <a href="http://utdirect.utexas.edu/txshop/list.WBX?component=0&amp;application_name=LNLINGUA">registration</a> and <a href="http://nasslli2012.com/scholarships">scholarships</a> online now. But hurry&#8230; this school will fill up to capacity, and I'm predicting the scholarships will all be gone within a couple of months.</p>
<p>Oh, and I want to ask all of you a big favor. Schools like NASSLLI can make a huge difference in a junior scholar's life, as I remember well from my own formative years as a graduate student. So it's very important that we get information about the school out. Please pass on information about NASSLLI (e.g. by sending <a href="http://nasslli2012.com">this link</a>) to anyone you think might be interested, and follow us, circlify us, and say you'll attend us on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nasslli">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-admin/Nasslli School (you)">Google+</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/300928343266509/">Facebook</a>, respectively. And bring your friends!</p>
