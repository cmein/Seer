<p>Jeffrey Archer is one of the world&#039;s most successful writers, having sold more than 350million books in 97 countries and in over 37 languages around the world.</p>
<p>But more than that, the British novelist is himself a great story.</p>
<p>He is also a playwright, a former parliamentarian and London mayor candidate, a champion athlete and a convicted criminal.</p>
<p>Archer&#039;s rise to international fame began with his first novel &#034;Not A Penny More, Not A Penny Less&#034; written in 1975 to repay creditors from a bad investment that left him on the brink of bankruptcy. It defied the critics and became a best-seller.</p>
<p>In the past 36 years, he has gone on to write a series of novels, plays and short stories including &#034;The Prison Diaries&#034; series written during his two year stint in jail following convictions for perjury and perverting the course of justice during a 1987 libel case against British tabloid &#034;The Daily Star&#034;.</p>
<p>Archer has now just finished penning his 16th novel Only Time Will Tell, the first in a proposed series known as The Clifton Chronicles.</p>
