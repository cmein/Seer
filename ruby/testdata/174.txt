<p class="noindent">ABSTRACT: PROFILE of crime reporter Jake Adelstein and the yakuza crime organizations in Japan. One of Japan’s foremost experts on organized crime is Jake Adelstein, who grew up on a farm in Missouri, became the first American to cover crime for a Japanese newspaper, and currently lives in central Tokyo under police protection. Adelstein is in his early forties, and he wears a trenchcoat and a porkpie hat, and he chain-smokes clove cigarettes from Indonesia. The police estimate that there are nearly eighty thousand members of yakuza organizations, whereas in America the Mafia had only five thousand in its heyday. Adelstein and the writer grew up in Columbia, Missouri. Back then, Adelstein’s name was Josh, and he was so cross-eyed that he had to have corrective surgery. Years later, he was given a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, a rare disorder of connective tissue. Adelstein spent his sophomore year of college in Tokyo and never came back. He transferred to a Japanese university, and he changed his name to Jake. Adelstein is believed to be the first American ever to become a police reporter for Tokyo’s <em>Yomiuri Shimbun</em>. Describes the history of the yakuza. Many yakuza became rich during the bubble economy of the eighties and nineties, and they developed extensive corporate structures. Nowadays, yakuza run hedge funds. They speculate in real estate. As a foreigner, Adelstein moves easily between the yakuza and the police. Yet he follows strict rules. He says that the key to his work is the Japanese concept of <em>giri</em>, or reciprocity. Describes a conversation between Adelstein and a gangster the writer refers to as Miyamoto. Miyamoto pointed Adelstein toward a possible connection between the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which owns and manages the Fukushima nuclear reactors, and the Matsuba-kai, a criminal organization. Over the summer, Adelstein published a number of articles in <em>The Atlantic</em> online, the London <em>Independent</em>, and some Japanese publications, exposing corruption and criminal links at TEPCO. At the <em>Yomiuri</em>, Adelstein started investigating the crime boss Tadamasa Goto. After a certain point, he says the paper balked at publishing more stories about Goto, and Adelstein quit. After leaving the <em>Yomiuri</em>, Adelstein kept investigating, until he discovered that Goto and three other yakuza had received liver transplants at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in the U.S., after making a deal with the F.B.I. to rat out other yakuza. Adelstein broke the story in May of 2008, first in the Washington <em>Post</em> and then with details he gave to reporters at the L.A. <em>Times</em>. He claims that Goto’s men contacted him before the story ran and warned him that he’d be killed if he published it. After that, Adelstein was placed under Tokyo police protection, and the F.B.I. monitored his wife, Sunao, and two children, who had moved to the U.S. During the spring, Adelstein received a diagnosis of liver cancer. Mentions Adelstein’s driver, Teruo Mochizuki, an ex-yakuza. Adelstein has published a book about his adventures on the police beat, “Tokyo Vice,” and is working on two more. He follows his strict rules of reciprocity and protection of sources, but otherwise Adelstein is willing to do nearly anything to get a story. By now, he’s played the stereotypical role of the crime reporter for so long that he can’t shake the life style. Mentions his father, Eddie Adelstein.</p>
