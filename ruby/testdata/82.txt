<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- I've never had a choice like this before.</p>
<p>I was doing some holiday shopping online earlier this month. On the left of my screen was a basic Kindle e-reader for the modest price of $79. On the right was the identical Kindle e-reader for the higher price of $109.</p>
<p>Same screen. Same buttons. Same functions. One difference. And Amazon is very transparent about this.</p>
<p>The $79 Kindle comes with what Amazon calls "Special Offers &amp; Sponsored Screensavers," which appear as screensavers and at the bottom of the home screen. "They do not interrupt reading," Amazon says.</p>
<p>The $109 version, on the other hand, is ad-free.</p>
<p>Which one would you choose? How much extra would you pay to keep out the ads?</p>
<p><strong>The ad that follows me</strong></p>
<p>We all know what's at stake here. I'm not paranoid. A paranoid person is someone who thinks he's being followed. I KNOW I'm being followed.</p>
<p>The other day I visited a website to check out a piece of jewelry for my wife. I liked one particular product so I found my way to that link. But I wasn't really sure about it. So I didn't buy it.</p>
<p>A couple of minutes later, I logged on to my Yahoo e-mail account. And there, on the right side of the screen, was a little advertisement for the product I had just visited and the link to take me there.</p>
<p>I am being followed by a piece of jewelry.</p>
<p>I'm told the company that sells the jewelry doesn't know my name. To them, I'm just a series of computer codes which allow a piece of software to follow me.</p>
<p>That same ad popped up on a number of occasions for the next day or so. I think the jewelry seller has given up now.</p>
<p>But I've had the same experience with other online searches, followed by the very same links popping up on my computer.</p>
<p>I don't think these companies are doing anything wrong to try to reach me. They're not saying: "Buy this -- we know where you live." Although they do know where I live online.</p>
<p>They're just saying -- well, they're saying what a shopkeeper once said to me 26 years ago in the souk of Old Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>'Don't think'</strong></p>
<p>The year was 1985. I had stopped by this man's open-air shop and casually admired a Turkish coffee set he had for sale.</p>
<p>He immediately named a price. I really did not want to buy the coffee set. I was simply admiring it.</p>
<p>He quickly lowered his price. I said, sincerely, I really wasn't interested.</p>
<p>He asked me to name a price. I said let me think.</p>
<p>Please, he said, name a price. I said, I'm thinking.</p>
<p>After another exchange like this, I quickly walked away.</p>
<p>Ten seconds later a boy tapped me on the back. Pointing to the shopkeeper, he relayed this message: "He said to tell you, 'Don't think.' "</p>
<p>That's all that's happening now. Some shopkeeper is following me from link to link -- following my electronic footprints.</p>
<p><strong>My Kindle tradeoff</strong></p>
<p>So fast forward 26 years, and here I was at this computer in my office, looking at Kindles. Yes, I was shopping at work (it was a short break).</p>
<p>That Kindle shopping excursion forced me to think about what I value. In this case, it's what I value for my son, who's in elementary school. He's the one who would be receiving the Kindle for the holidays.</p>
<p>And the last thing I want for him is to get "The Call of the Salesman" before he reads "The Call of the Wild."</p>
<p>I could afford the extra $30 to give him that pure experience of picking up a great book with no distractions. So I paid the premium for a Kindle without ads.</p>
<p>I don't begrudge the advertisers. Their dollars ultimately pay my salary, and maybe yours too.</p>
<p>But each of us has to figure out whether we're willing to pay for what we now get for free. The e-mail services. The search services. The social-networking tools. All paid for by giving advertisers direct access to us.</p>
<p>It's a tradeoff. And the Kindle is forcing us to evaluate that tradeoff and put a price tag on it.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, there will always be someone there to tap us on the back and tell us: "Don't think." Everyone has to make a living.</p>
