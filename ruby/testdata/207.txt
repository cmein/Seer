<p class="descender">On October 2nd, a few weeks after Occupy Wall Street began, Colin Robinson, a British man with a head of loose gray curls, fished a Natural Light beer case out of a trash can in Chelsea. He tore off a rectangle of brown cardboard, folded it into the shape of a book’s cover and spine, and wrote, in Sharpie, “Occupying Wall Street: The Inside Story of an Action That Changed America.” Where the author’s name would normally go, he scribbled, “Writers for the 99%.” He did not yet know who the writers would be, but he set out to find volunteers. Robinson, an erstwhile Trotskyist and a current “unapologetic leftist,” is the <span id="corrected"/> <span id="correctionasterisk">co-publisher</span> of a boutique press called OR Books. He has published Christopher Hitchens and Noam Chomsky, but this is his first book by a leaderless movement. “I wanted to audition writers, but it became very clear that would not fly. So I thought, Let’s just try it and see what happens.” Eventually, a group took shape, with a rotating membership of about sixty—“some more involved than others,” Robinson admitted—who interviewed key figures in the movement and wrote collaboratively in Google Docs. In 1948, the editors of the Washington <em>Post</em> promised their readers “a first rough-draft of history.” Now, thanks to digital print-on-demand technology, historians can work like journalists.</p>
<p>The book writers met not in Zuccotti Park but at 60 Wall Street, a capacious indoor space with central heating, free Wi-Fi, potted palm trees, and mirrored tiles on the ceiling. Deutsche Bank occupies the forty-seven stories overhead, but the atrium is, like Zuccotti, a “privately owned public space”—a phrase that meant nothing to anyone until three months ago, when it suddenly came to mean quite a lot. On a recent afternoon, about twenty writers gathered around a table to discuss logistics. A freelance journalist named Debbie Nathan said, “I’ve heard parts of the park were called ‘the ghetto.’ I’ve heard people say, ‘I slept in the library, because it was safer, because the people there were more educated.’ Is that something we can address?”</p>
<p>“I hope we do address it,” Kathryn Mahaney, a doctoral student in history at <small>CUNY</small>, who was facilitating the meeting, said. “But through the lens of ‘These are problems in our society, not unique to this movement.’ ” People expressed assent through head nods, rather than hand signals.</p>
<p>Alejandro Gomez-del-Moral, who is writing his dissertation on the rise of consumerism in Franco-era Spain, asked, “We’re going for third-person past tense, right? Because I saw some first-person stuff in the Google Doc.”</p>
<p>“Everything should be third person,” Mahaney agreed. “We want a unified voice.”</p>
<p>“How does everyone feel about ‘This writer saw’?”</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re reporting on it, it’s assumed you saw it, right?”</p>
<p>A. J. Bauer, who wrote his master’s thesis on the Tea Party, asked about citations: “Are we using M.L.A. style, Chicago style, A.P.A.?”</p>
<p>After a moment of confusion, the group consented to Chicago style. Robinson clarified: “No footnotes—all citations within the text.”</p>
<p>“So really more like A.P.A., then,” Bauer muttered.</p>
<p>Mahaney asked how each chapter was progressing. “The Future of the Occupation” was looking good; “Art in the Square” was nearly finished. Mahaney had volunteered to write a chapter about the General Assembly. “To be honest, I haven’t started it yet,” she said. “But I swear it will be in on time.” The deadline was six days away.</p>
<p>Robinson describes OR Books’ business plan as more “nimble” and less “stupid” than the standard publishing model. “We don’t have warehouses,” he said. “We only do print-on-demand and e-books, and we sell directly from our Web site.” This allows OR to work quickly. All the chapters of “Occupying Wall Street” were in by Tuesday, November 29th, mere hours behind schedule. Robinson and a few other editors spent three days cobbling together a draft, which they sent to a copy editor that Friday night. On Monday, Robinson e-mailed a Word file to a typesetting company in Chennai, India. Four days later, he approved the final proof, and sent a PDF to a digital printing company in Minneapolis. On December 16th, the book was mailed to more than a thousand people who had preordered it. Its cover was Robinson’s handwriting on a beer-stained cardboard box. <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
