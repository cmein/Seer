<p><strong>Vics </strong>has grown up, and so has its original clientele. This new <strong>lounge </strong>from the Vics group acknowledges that reality with less emphasis on people-watching and dancing &ndash; and more attention paid to <strong>design </strong>and <strong>drinks</strong>. It&rsquo;s <strong>slick, classy and chilled</strong>, with intimate VIP rooms and seating areas. There&rsquo;s a dance floor and DJ booth, but this place isn&rsquo;t about party ambiance. You&rsquo;re more likely to stick to your own crowd than make new friends.</p>
