<p><strong>Moscow (CNN)</strong> -- A fire on a docked Russian nuclear submarine should be fully extinguished within a few hours, Russia's emergency minister said Friday according to state media.</p>
<p>Flames spread to the nuclear vessel Yekaterinburg Thursday after material caught fire at a repair dock in Roslyakovo, which is in the Murmansk region in northwest Russia, on the Barents Sea, the official Itar-Tass news agency reported.</p>
<p>Minister of Emergency Situations Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of emergency officials that over 3,000 gallons of water a minute are being poured on to the submarine's hull to cool it down, the agency said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the military prosecutor's office in the Northern Fleet, Alexander Grigoryev, said seven people are being treated in hospital for carbon monoxide poisoning from the scene of the fire, Itar-Tass reported.</p>
<p>He said the fire had been "localized" and that the prosecutor's investigation into the cause of the fire was continuing, the agency said.</p>
<p>The submarine was undergoing planned repairs at the dry dock when the blaze broke out and its nuclear reactors were already halted, Itar-Tass said.</p>
<p>Radiation levels in the Roslyakovo area are within normal background levels, the Emergencies Ministry in the Murmansk region said in a statement on its website, indicating there is no threat to the local population.</p>
<p>Capt. Vadim Sega, a spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet, said the fire never penetrated the hull and so did not spread inside the vessel.</p>
<p>"There is no possibility of fire burning through the hull, and no threat to on-board equipment," Sega said Thursday, according to the official RIA-Novosti news agency.</p>
<p>One of seven Delta-IV class submarines in operation, the Yekaterinburg carries 16 ballistic missiles. According to the military research website RusNavy.com, the vessel was launched in September 1984, has two nuclear reactors and can carry a 140-person crew.</p>
