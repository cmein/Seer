<p><strong>Across Europe</strong> - Like hundreds of thousands if not millions of others I found myself a considerable distance from home when the volcanic ash from Iceland grounded my flight. As it turns out, I was almost a thousand miles away from my family, friends and my building site of a kitchen.</p>
<p>It was Thursday and I was in Warsaw, Poland and I was hoping to fly to London, England. I had been there since the previous weekend, organizing CNN’s coverage of the plane crash which claimed the lives of the Polish president, his wife and 94 other government and army officials.</p>
<p>When I first heard about the volcanic ash I wasn’t paying a great deal of attention to the disruption that was going to severely impact the rest of my week because I was rather preoccupied with the next stage of our coverage in Poland.</p>
<p>We were planning for the arrival of several world leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama, Britain’s Prince Charles, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, among others.</p>
<p>We thought it best for Phil Black and his team to head to Krakow to make arrangements for Sunday – coverage of a state funeral with hundreds of thousands of mourners descending on a small city takes some planning. I stayed in Warsaw with our Germany correspondent Fred Pleitgen and helped with arrangements for the memorial service in the capital on Saturday.</p>
<p>I was rather naively hoping the ash cloud problems would literally blow over and I’d be clear to fly home on Friday morning. I spoke with our travel department and tried to book the flight home, but I was told UK airspace would be closed until at least Friday morning. By this time I wouldn’t have got very far from Warsaw so I decided to stay on for another night.</p>
<p>The next morning it was fairly obvious that I wasn’t going to fly anywhere on Friday or even Saturday – closures were announced in Poland and at airport after airport in several countries across Europe. This was not going away – quite the opposite, it was developing into an incredible story which would affect hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>I called the news desk and the plan was for me to try and get home “any way I possibly could” and of course to film my experiences en route. Fred’s brief was to find personal stories about people’s problems and we didn’t have to try too hard. He and his cameraman Paul Devitt overheard a group of travelers chatting at a nearby table. They were trying to make their way across the continent and were closely studying a map over coffee. Fortunately for us they agreed to do an interview.</p>
<p>As I later discovered this was a common response; it’s not a disaster and to my knowledge nobody has died as a result. It’s an act of nature that has affected the vast majority of people &#8211; even those not directly caught up in the chaos will know someone who has been – and it’s an event which has brought out the best in people. Certainly that was my impression.<br />
<strong><br />
Next stop Berlin</strong></p>
<p>After consulting the map I thought I would start the long journey home by taking the train in the direction of Berlin.</p>
<p>I checked out of the hotel and hailed a cab to the station. Bad move in hindsight. There were massive queues, and some people I spoke to had been waiting for six hours to buy a ticket without any guarantees of boarding a train that day.</p>
<p>Plan B was required (I think I’m now on about plan G or H) so I tried to rent a car. I was told by the only rental company willing to let me take a car out of the country that I would have to wait for at least seven hours to get my hands on a vehicle.</p>
<p>This was not an option as CNN were expecting me to have reached at least Berlin that evening. So I cleared it with the boss and went in search of a cab. To be honest I was a bit relieved – I didn’t really fancy the prospect of such a long drive on my own.</p>
<p>So I called the hotel and was told the driver wanted 2,500 Polish zloty (about US$900) to take me to the German capital. I thought I could do better that that, and asked a local taxi driver sitting in the rank outside Warsaw station. He was pretty happy about the request and asked for 2,200 zloty, about a hundred bucks cheaper. The deal was done but more importantly I was on the move.</p>
<p>As we crawled through the suburbs of Warsaw it occurred to me that across Europe millions of people were all experiencing an unprecedented feeling of paralysis; we’re used to being able to travel by land, sea or air and when one of those options is cut off the other two simply can’t cope, such is the level of demand from society.</p>
<p>However, this was not a subject I was able to discuss with my taxi driver Rafa, because he spoke very little English and I had only picked up two words in Polish – both of which mean ‘OK’.</p>
<p>He did manage to establish early on that I wasn’t a massive fan of heavy metal music after he stuck ‘Stairway to Heaven’ on full blast on the radio when we got out of Warsaw. We resorted to the international language of pointing, he put his sunglasses on and pretty much ignored me for the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Those of you who’ve driven across Poland will know it’s not the greatest visual experience – I soon got pretty used to the relentless landscape of farms and tractors. There’s not a lot to see between Warsaw and Berlin.</p>
<p>And those of you who take cabs will complain that often the driver talks too much. In my case, as you can imagine, I wished Rafa and I could just talk about something! I didn’t even have a book with me.</p>
<p>I was told the 375-mile drive would take about seven hours, but with a couple of stops and a few traffic jams we didn’t roll in to Berlin until 11 p.m. – nine hours after leaving Warsaw. Rafa and I got a few smiles from the locals who could see by the signs on his cab that he, like so many others, was now a very long way from home. I was utterly exhausted and didn’t even think about the next part of the trip.</p>
<p><strong>We’re in it together</strong></p>
<p>I was given permission by the boss to spend the day in Berlin and get moving first thing in the morning. This was probably just as well as the trains were booked, flights again grounded and the only car I could hire had a tiny engine and wasn’t available until the afternoon.</p>
<p>Time to consider my options for the morning. Do I drive to Brussels and try and get the Eurostar? Failing that should I press on and get a ferry from Calais? Or what about a Dutch port – certainly closer to Berlin than Belgium or France.</p>
<p>Everywhere I turned I heard similar conversations – it’s difficult to convey exactly how far and wide the behavior of an Icelandic volcano has impacted European life. Practically everyone has a story to tell. In fact I haven’t yet found anyone who hasn’t.</p>
<p>I spent the night in Berlin and went out for a drink with our correspondent Diana Magnay. Predictably a man standing next to us at the bar was stuck in town too. He was a New York-based businessman who owned a stainless steel company. He’d been told he may have to wait a week to get a flight back to the States after coming over for a short conference.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning I decided to try the train first. Claudia Otto, the Berlin-based camera operator for CNN, suggested a train to Rotterdam, Holland and then a ferry to the UK would be the best option. We had both been trying without success to buy a Eurostar ticket from Brussels, Belgium so that wasn’t an immediate option.</p>
<p>The queue for tickets at Berlin looked pretty long but incredibly I was able to buy one from the machine for the next train to Rotterdam. The station was much calmer than Warsaw had been two days earlier; many travelers had clearly managed to escape or were prepared to sit and wait for their revised departure. Or perhaps it’s another notch on the belt for German efficiency!</p>
<p>I was moving again but more bad news: word had reached me that I had no chance of getting a ferry to the UK today and very little chance tomorrow.</p>
<p>There is a cruel irony here, one which I fully deserve to be on the receiving end. The ferries from Rotterdam go to Hull and Harwich in the UK. Being a proud Londoner I have often teased our Atlanta-based director of coverage Roger Clark about his home town – Hull. And being the proudest of all Yorkshiremen he’s always game for a robust conversation. Today, which will surely be the only time in my life I am actually desperate to go to Hull, I can’t physically get there.</p>
<p>As we approached the Germany-Holland border there was yet more evidence of the far-reaching consequences of Volcanogate. I got chatting to my fellow train passengers and discovered that practically everyone sitting near me has had their lives turned upside down over the past few days by the ash.</p>
<p>First was sports journalist John Dillon. He had been enjoying a short break in Berlin with his two sons, Gregory, 13, and nine-year-old Nicholas. The best he could arrange was a ferry from Amsterdam to Newcastle in the UK, which is more than four hours on a train from their home town, London. But he was delighted to have booked the last berth.</p>
<p>John, who writes for the Daily Express, says there are worse places to be stuck, but the children seemed a bit bored by their marathon return journey. And Nicholas was going to miss out on a school trip. His classmates from Oakdale Junior School in London were off to Wales. Their head teacher won’t be joining them either – John said she was “stuck” on holiday in Madeira.</p>
<p>Either side of me was two Dutch businessmen – Luc De Haan and Ramses Van Hovell. Luc is a fabric salesman and he was on business in Minsk. He was coming to the end of a 24-hour train trip and was nearly at his final destination of Borne in Holland.</p>
<p>Ramses runs his own online marketing company. He had been to Kiev in the Ukraine and is nearing the end of his 33-hour train trip. He was very relaxed about the whole thing – I guess that much time on a train has that effect on people.</p>
<p>One passenger told me there’s never a good time for this to happen. It’s true for me too – my fiancée has been left with our wedding plans for next month, and my colleagues are concerned about our coverage of the UK elections. But there could be a silver lining on this volcanic ash cloud adventure for me at least – my kitchen will probably be built by the time I get home.</p>
<p>It’s nearly time to get off the train at Amersfoort and change for Rotterdam but I’ve just had a call from Hull’s finest and been asked to change the plan and head to Amsterdam. We’re hearing there is the slightest possibility that Dutch airline KLM may start flying planes tomorrow after some successful test flights today. Clearly, I’m needed on that. Let’s see what happens next.</p>
