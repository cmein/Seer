<p><strong>New Delhi, India (CNN)</strong> -- Seventeen people died after drinking a toxic, illegal home-brewed liquor over the New Years weekend in southern India, authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>At least 18 people were also poisoned by what authorities have described as contaminated moonshine in Andhra Pradesh's Krishna district, P.V.S. Ramkrishna, the district police chief, said.</p>
<p>Police in India have been cracking down recently on businesses selling the illegally-made alcohol, Ramkrishna said.</p>
<p>In December, authorities arrested 10 people for making contaminated moonshine that left at least 168 people dead in the Indian state of West Bengal. Hundreds more were sickened by it, authorities said.</p>
<p>Moonshine is not uncommon in poverty-stricken communities in India because it is cheap to make.</p>
