<p><strong>Shanghai, China</strong> - On the opening day of the World Expo, we set up our live shot on the corner of gate 5, in the shadow of the towering China Pavilion. Two hours before the park officially opened, Chinese visitors had already lined up in at least ten wide lines, spilling out onto the street.</p>
<p>It was packed but relatively orderly, with families showing us their tickets. People were excited to step into what many Chinese, including Premier Wen Jiabao, are calling the realization of a &#034;100-year-old dream.&#034; Many had packed their lunches and snacks for the day after hearing it might take hours to snag a table in an Expo restaurant.</p>
<p>The majority of Chinese people never leave China. For those willing to brave the crowds on opening day, this was their chance to see the world. Many weren&#039;t even from Shanghai, but had traveled by plane or train from the provinces. This was a big day.</p>

<p>&#034;I&#039;ll stay as long as I need to to see everything,&#034; said 10-year-old Zhang Hao, with a streak of delight in his eyes as he waited in line.</p>
<p>He did not get to see everything â€“ far from it. When the gates opened, people literally ran in. The initial amazement at the diverse, colorful, looming pavilions quickly turned into exasperation.</p>
<p>Visitors were told they couldn&#039;t see the China pavilion unless they had a reservation. But, reservations were already gone for the day. Guests from across the country were confused by the ticket reservation machines and the directives of volunteers, who themselves admitted they were confounded by how access on the first day was so difficult.</p>
<p>Lines at other pavilions quickly piled up, especially those that had gotten heavy media attention. By 10 a.m., the line for Japan was four hours long. Visitors had been promised they would see a band of robots playing violins and witness a massive eco-friendly heating and cooling system inside.</p>

<p>Same story at Saudi Arabia. The most expensive pavilion, which reportedly cost $164 million, boasts one of the biggest movie screens in the world and date palm trees imported from the Middle East.</p>
<p>This is when I saw people start to get visibly angry.</p>
<p>&#034;Four hours!&#034; one man screamed at the back of line. &#034;And they&#039;re all like this. We flew here from Guangdong!&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;This is ridiculous,&#034; another yelled. &#034;You regret it if you come, you regret it if you don&#039;t come.&#034;</p>
<p>As the clock struck noon, temperatures turned sweltering and some people just gave up. Children pouted with ice cream while their parents scanned maps to figure out how to get from Nepal to the Netherlands. Grown-ups slouched on benches, holding their jackets and free maps over their heads for shade.</p>
<p>Note: Shade at the Expo is scarce. There are standing umbrellas scattered throughout the park, but other than that people tend to crowd under the narrow awnings of restaurants or in the shadows of the pavilions themselves. The Dutch pavilion proved to be a popular spot for its ample shade. My photographer, Brad Olson, faced the heat bravely with his heavy camera. We had the great fortune of stumbling on a rare Minute Maid orange juice stand in the middle of our odyssey from Spain to Brazil.</p>
<p>Also, the park is a massive navigational nightmare. There are five giant districts, with just a few transportation routes. Lucky VIPs (and no, that does not include the media) whiz around in golf carts while the masses traipse across the park slowly in the heat. Japan and the USA, for example, are on opposite ends, about an hour&#039;s walking distance. To get from one end to the other you have to find an out-of-the-way bus stop where Expo shuttles pick up and drop off.</p>

<p>Understandably, nobody wants to walk the long distance in the heat, so the shuttles are over-packed. I literally almost got squished when a shuttle door opened. My producer Jo Kent was nearly trampled by tourists.</p>
<p>The time it takes to get from one place to another, on top of the lines, means some people may have gotten inside only three or four pavilions at most in a single day. Many we spoke with said they were too exhausted to come back another time. Others strategized to only visit pavilions with short wait times. One tourist told Jo on the shuttle bus, &#034;I don&#039;t mind going to the smaller pavilions if that&#039;s what it means to beat the lines. Plus maybe I&#039;ll learn more than in the big ones. I&#039;ve never even heard of the Seychelles; they could be interesting.&#034;</p>
<p>However, despite the many complaints, there were plenty of people willing to wait it out, standing patiently in the line for Denmark to see Copenhagen&#039;s famous little mermaid or the popular &#034;seed cathedral&#034; at the UK pavilion, for example. Others enjoyed performances at an outdoor stage on the Square of the Americas, where festive dancers and violinists donning sombreros delighted the crowds.</p>
<p>For some, the wait was worth it.</p>
<p>Little Zhang Hao&#039;s trip started with disappointment when it was clear he wouldn&#039;t be seeing Japan or China. But his family rallied and waited it out at South Korea, to be delighted by futuristic video games, a Korean drum concert and endless multimedia focusing on the environment and technology.</p>
<p>&#034;It&#039;s really cool here,&#034; his mother, Wu Jun, said on their way out. &#034;Even if we can&#039;t get inside every pavilion, seeing it from the outside is pretty amazing.&#034;</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Zhang family has never left China before. They didn&#039;t get to see the whole world at the Shanghai Expo, but they certainly felt like they caught a glimpse.</p>
