(We made &#8220;Annabel&#8221; up. But could you imagine– !) Amy wined, dined, chatted, danced, shimmied, shimmered, gave speeches, danced some more, won the titles of Mr. <em>and</em> Mrs. Penn (we wish), had a picnic at her house, bought some new red blazers, coiffed her hair (<em>That hair!</em>), went to bed and did it 364 more times. Let&#8217;s take a trip down memory lane and relive some of her best moments, shall we?</p>

</a></strong>Amy went to Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum and Huffington had the nerve to show up with a blonde &#8216;do. Only one blonde superwoman per table, please, them&#8217;s the rules. Arianna who? #TeamAmy</p>

</a></strong>The <em>Daily Beast</em> called up Amy one day and they were like, &#8220;Amy! Hi! It&#8217;s the <em>Daily Beast</em>. So we just wanted to let you know that you&#8217;re one of the 150 most influential women in the world right now. That sounds about right, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Amy would&#8217;ve responded, but she was jetting off to D.C. to serve as a chair in one of President Obama&#8217;s commissions while raising $3 billion for Penn. Tough life!</p>

</strong>Back in March, in the height of Penn Madness, the Gut was named a finalist against <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/03/penn-madness-final-round-polls-have-opened/" target="_blank">The Late Night</a>. Unfortunately, the 50-piece Chicken McNuggets <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/03/penn-madness-has-ended-the-winner-is/" target="_blank">swooped in and stole her glory</a> right from her hands. An unfair match, but a victory for the McNuggets nonetheless.</p>

</a></strong>Over the summer, Amy headed over to Seoul, South Korea to establish a relationship with Seoul National University and show off a glammin&#8217; dress. &#8220;YOU&#8217;RE THE CAT&#8217;S MEOW!&#8221; shrieked everyone at Penn.</p>

</a></strong>Back in August, the fine folks over at <em>Philadelphia Magazine</em> sat down with the Prez for an open, honest conversation. She opened up about her deepest, darkest secrets, like the fact that she can stand on her head (Her fave party trick!) and how political rhetoric gets her in a tizzy. Us too, Amy, us too!</p>

</a></strong>Amy! She&#8217;s just like us! She gets Capogiro gelato and rolls her eyes at the baristas&#8217; trendier-than-thou glares! What flavor did you get Amy, huh? We recommend the Sweet Amish Milk. Did you bring some home for Leah Popowich?</p>

</a></strong>Nobody&#8217;s perfect, and Amy showed her human side when she used Comic Sans in her Holiday Study Break flyers. Oh, Amy! Why! You left us in the cold– without even a serif to keep us warm!</p>
<p>We&#8217;d hate to end the year on such a low note, so <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dr-amy-gutmann-penn-president/sets/72157628393244805/" target="_blank">take a peek</a> at Amy&#8217;s holiday reception at her house. (Warning: dusty rose blazer ahead.)</p>
