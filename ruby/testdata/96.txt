<p>Jose Antonio Vargas has spent almost two decades trying to stay out of the spotlight in the United States.</p>
<p>Why? Because he&#039;s been living in America since the age of 12 as an undocumented immigrant.</p>
<p>But over the past seven years, hiding his illegal status has been increasingly difficult for the Philippines-born journalist who has been acclaimed for his coverage of HIV and the Virginia Tech shootings which culminated in a Pulitzer Prize in 2008.</p>
<p>Vargas&#039; success also earned him a Wikipedia page and his fear of being found and deported heightened.</p>
<p>Finally, in June, Vargas decided reveal the truth about his immigration status in New York Times Magazine, using his confession to promote dialogue about what he describes as America&#039;s broken immigration system.</p>
<p>He has started the advocacy group Define American which has attracted more than 95,000 signatures on a petition that calls for a new conversation on an issue that affects millions of illegal immigrants living in the United States.</p>
