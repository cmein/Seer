<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- Fiji's prime minister announced Sunday that the Pacific island nation would soon lift its longtime state of emergency and begin drawing up a new constitution.</p>
<p>Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who seized power in a 2006 coup, made the announcement in a New Year's message to Fiji residents, according to a statement on his website.</p>
<p>In addition to lifting the state of emergency Saturday, he vowed that a national consultative process would begin "in the next few weeks" to start charting out a new constitution.</p>
<p>"The constitution must establish a government that is founded on an electoral system that guarantees equal suffrage -- a truly democratic system based on the principle of one person, one vote, one value," said Bainimarama, who is also Fiji's military chief.</p>
<p>He added that the new system should not "classify Fijians based on ethnicity," saying all men and women 18 years and older "must have the right to vote."</p>
<p>For years, Bainimarama has promised to reform the country's electoral system and eradicate "endemic corruption." But many one-time allies have criticized him for not moving fast enough and not allowing a democracy to flourish.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth -- a voluntary, cooperative alliance of 54 nations that were once part of the British Empire and formerly known as the British Commonwealth -- suspended Fiji from its ranks about two years ago after its military rulers failed to respond to a demand to restore democracy. That meant Fiji would no longer receive aid from the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Fiji was expelled from the Pacific Forum in 2009 after failing to meet a similar deadline set by that multinational bloc.</p>
<p>That decision came a month after a court ruling that declared Fiji's military government illegal and ordered that a caretaker government be instituted. Yet that didn't happen, as Bainimarama was sworn in yet again as prime minister, the country's constitution was annulled and all judges were fired.</p>
<p>The 2006 coup was Fiji's fourth since it became independent of Britain in 1970.</p>
