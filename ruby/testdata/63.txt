<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- At least three people were killed in the western Syrian city of Hama on Sunday, according to an opposition activist group.</p>
<p>The Local Coordination Committees of Syria said a child was among its tally of "martyrs," but did not provide additional information.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the state-run Syrian Arab News agency said Sunday that the bodies of 21 troops "killed in the line of duty by armed terrorist groups" were taken from military hospitals to their final resting places.</p>
<p>CNN cannot independently verify accounts of violence or reports of deaths and injuries in Syria. President Bashar al-Assad's government has restricted access by international journalists.</p>

<p>In mid-March, al-Assad began a crackdown on anti-government protesters calling for his ouster. The Syrian government has repeatedly blamed "armed terrorist groups" for violence during the uprising.</p>
<p>The LCC, which has a network of contacts across Syria, said that more than 5,800 people were killed in 2011 during the crackdown on opposition protests.</p>
<p>Protesters turned out Saturday for anti-regime rallies in restive cities, including Homs, Idlib and Hama, activists said. They occurred as an Arab League fact-finding mission continued its work to determine whether the Syrian government is abiding by a peace agreement to end a brutal crackdown on protesters.</p>
<p>On Friday, two major Syrian opposition groups forged a deal that charts a course for democracy if al-Assad's regime crumbles -- a move which analysts said signals maturation and strengthening of the anti-regime forces.</p>
<p>After talks that lasted for more than a month, representatives of the Syrian National Council and the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change in Syria signed an agreement late Friday in Cairo for a transition in a post-Assad era, the NCB said on its Facebook page.</p>
<p>The agreement was scheduled to be filed with the Arab League on Sunday, the NCB said.</p>
<p>Opposition groups hope to end the al-Assad regime's push against demonstrators and its efforts to maintain power across the country.</p>
<p>The Arab League, the United States, the European Union and Turkey have condemned the government crackdown and initiated sanctions. But Russia and China have stood in the way of a strong U.N. Security Council resolution toward the Syrian government.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, al-Assad agreed to a peace initiative with the Arab League that calls for security forces to withdraw from cities, release detainees and end violence. Part of the agreement calls for Arab League observers to monitor whether the government abides by the initiative.</p>
