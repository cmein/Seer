<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- Egypt's ruling military council has moved up the scheduled elections for the upper house of parliament by nearly three weeks, with voting now scheduled to start in late January, the state news agency MENA reported Sunday.</p>
<p>Balloting will be held in two stages instead of three, first on January 29-30 and then on February 14-15, MENA said, citing a decree from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. The goal is to have winners seated by February 28.</p>
<p>Elections for the lower house were completed in December.</p>
<p>The generals have ruled Egypt since the revolt that toppled longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak last February. Sunday's announcement follows weeks of street protests calling on them to cede power to a civilian government.</p>
