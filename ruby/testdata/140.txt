Penn loves the Internet. Suffice to say, we&#8217;re just one big Internet-loving community filled with a number of people who forget that <em>what you send in an e-mail may be posted on the Internet</em>. Which is why our final Best Of 2011 brings you the best of listserv abuse, e-mail snafus and some all-around gems. Take note for 2012, or odds are high you end up on this very list next year.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/03/some-awesome-engineer-hacked-got-classes-cancelled/" target="_blank">Three Cheers for the Engineers</a></strong></strong><br />
Who boldly hacked into an administrator&#8217;s e-mail account and sent a message cancelling select engineering classes for the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/02/kid-gets-sassed-by-teacher-in-front-of-whole-listserv/" target="_blank"><strong>Teachers Is Pimps, Too</strong></a><br />

<p><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/06/insurance-office-pump-the-brakes/" target="_blank">SHS, WTF.</a></strong><br />
Health insurance managed to become ten times more confusing this summer when we received not one, not two, not three, but four e-mails explaining the enrollment period.</p>

Taking &#8220;networking&#8221; to a new level, this ambitious senior overtly e-mailed practically all of Wall Street. BCC, ever heard of it?</p>
<p><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/12/how-to-beat-listserv-abuse-by-abusing-the-listserv/" target="_blank"><strong>Passive Aggressive Calls Out Information Hungry STSC-ers</strong></a><br />
Nothing like a little sarcasm over the <em>entire</em> class listserv to put those seeking finals notes back in their place. This kid: 1, class skippers: 0.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/02/found-on-a-frat-listserv-shower-power-2/" target="_blank">Frat Boy Douche Rankings</a></strong><br />
That time a very clean fraternity brother disclosed the ups and downs of the showers in his house, earning a thumbs up for his snarky annotations and fairly detailed depictions.</p>
<p><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/12/post-semester-listserv-oopsies/" target="_blank"><strong>&#8220;#$%@ I JUST REPLIED ALL TO THE WHOLE CLASS!!&#8221;</strong></a><br />
Talk about lousy with a capital L. Not only does everyone in the class know this kid&#8217;s grade, but they also know that this CIS student can&#8217;t properly compute basic arithmetic, either.</p>
