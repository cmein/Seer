The smell of money is everywhere.</div><br /><div>Dubai not only welcomes, but courts foreign labor. Ninety percent of residents in the United Arab Emirates are non-local. Tax breaks for corporations attract European and American expatriates (the "expat community" as they're called.)</div><br /><div></div><div>The Emirs of the city state have -- in a single generation -- created a world contained in a bubble, where Gulf cultural traditions seem to happily co-exist with a more relaxed Western lifestyle. </div><div><br /></div><div>But, today's news that a British couple has been sentenced to three months in prison for engaging in sex on a beach in public while drunk sends a message that there a limits to Dubai's tolerance. </div><div></div><br /><div>It's not the sentence against Vince <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Acors</span> and Michelle Palmer I'm struck by, but the fact that once made public, authorities appeared happy for it to be discussed and covered all over the world.</div><div></div><br /><div>I'm also surprised some Western journalists and commentators have described the incident as Dubai enforcing a strict Islamic code of conduct. Am I wrong in thinking that having sex in public is also illegal in most Western countries?</div><div></div><br /><div>Of course it wouldn't lead to a prison sentence and deportation, but I'm pretty sure a couple would get in at least a little bit of trouble with the law for doing the same thing in Paris, London or New York.</div><br /><div></div><div></div><div>The couple deny having had sexual intercourse but what Dubai is saying is clear: you can drink and canoodle with a partner, but keep it safely out of sight and behind closed doors.</div><div></div><br /><div>What do you think about the sentence?
