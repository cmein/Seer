The wife of jailed Saudi Arabian activist Matrook Al-Faleh sent CNN producer Mohammed Jamjoom this note from her husband's defense team.<br /><br />Jamila Al-Faleh says the lawyers for Al-Faleh,  whom human rights organizations say was jailed for criticizing prison conditions in his country, will go on a hunger strike to protest their client's detention conditions.<br /><br />The Saudi Interior Ministry has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment. Below is a note from Al-Faleh's defense team:<br /><br />"The Saudi Justice system and legal procedures (e.g., Criminal Procedure and Arrest and Detention Laws) have failed to render just judgments to jailed Saudi human-right activists who have been arrested with no official indictments, and incarcerated indefinitely in solitary confinement with no right to an attorney or access to habeas corpus.<br /><br />After exerting all means to get fair treatments to the constitutional movementâ€™s detainees, the defense teams decided to observe a 48-hour hunger strike. The proposed strike will take place on Thursday and Friday, 6-7 November 2008, in protest against flagrant human rights violations for all detainees in Saudi prisons who have been deprived of their basic rights as guaranteed by [the Saudi] Criminal Procedure Law and Arrest and Detention Law."
