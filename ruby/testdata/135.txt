<p>The voice that once gave melody to a movement is now, at times, no louder than a whisper.</p>
<p>Ill heath has taken its toll one of Namibia’s best-known musicians, Jackson Kaujeua. But on the 20th anniversary of his country’s independence the 57-year-old singer’s message is as clear as ever.</p>
<p>“I lived it, I ate it, I felt it,” Kaujeua says of his country’s liberation struggle.</p>
<p>“Music was very important. Way back it was undeveloped, but it was a very good tool for mobilization. It made people, especially the international community, realize what was happening in Namibia.”</p>
<p>Kaujeua may be best known for his struggle song “Winds of Change.” It helped to define not only Namibia’s struggle, but also similar liberation movements across Africa.</p>
<p>“It was sweet, it was simple and close to the hearts of people,” said Kaujeua of his song. “Hearing about other African colonies; Angola, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, South Africa, gave me the feeling that, if there were others that were free, we would also be free one day.”</p>
<p>For Kaujeua, most of the independence struggle was spent performing in exile. He lived 15 years in Botswana, Zambia, Angola, the United Kingdom and Sweden before finally returning to Namibia in 1989 on the eve of independence.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s anybody who wants to be living in exile your whole life,” Kaujeua says. “I always longed of coming back home - the question was when and how. But we were always talking of when Namibia is free, when Namibia is free. We knew that we would be free. It kept us living and kept us strong. It kept us striving.”</p>
<p>Kidney failure now keeps Kaujeua in and out of the hospital and away from performing, but he still was able to attend the country’s recent independence celebrations. As to the next 20 years of independence, the singer carries a simple message.</p>
<p>“I hope for a peaceful country because we went through war and it should be enough. We should know better.”</p>
