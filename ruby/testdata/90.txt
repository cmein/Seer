<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- Top seeds Czech Republic have opened their Hopman Cup campaign with a 2-1 Group A victory over Bulgaria on Monday.</p>
<p>World number two Petra Kvitova set the ball rolling in Perth with a 6-4 6-2 success over Tsvetana Pironkova, ranked 46th in the world.</p>
<p>And men's number seven Tomas Berdych secured the triumph after defeating Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 6-7 6-3.</p>

<p>Kvitova believes she will be under more pressure this year, after a remarkable 2011 which saw her win both Wimbledon and the WTA Tour Championships -- as well as leading the Czech Republic to their Fed Cup triumph.</p>

<p>"Every season is different. One year ago I was 34th in the world and now I am world ranked second." Kvitova told reporters after her victory.</p>
<p>"It is not always easy to play on the court and the first match of the year is always tough, but I played well."</p>
<p>The Bulgarian pairing earned a consolation by saving three match points to win the dead mixed-doubles rubber 2-6 6-3 11-9.</p>
