<p class="noindent">ABSTRACT: LETTER FROM CAIRO about the Omar Makram Mosque and the new round of protests in Tahrir Square. Tells about Mohammed Gemel, whom the writer met in Tahrir Square. A senior at Ain Shams University, Gemel had skipped a midterm exam so he could be at the square. He said that usually he was an excellent student, but last spring he had failed some courses because he had spent so much time participating in the revolution, which had forced President Hosni Mubarak to resign, in February. Since then, Egypt had been under the stewardship of the military. The country still lacked a new constitution, and elections had been delayed. The people were scheduled to choose a new parliament in a series of votes beginning in late November, but there had been reports that a Presidential election might not happen until 2013. As the parliamentary vote approached, the military attempted to grant itself some permanent political powers, a move that had sparked the current round of protests. These demonstrations had first been organized by the country’s Islamist political parties. The Muslim Brotherhood was the largest of these groups, and it was considered the favorite in the upcoming elections. A one-day protest on Tahrir had been peaceful, but violence erupted the following day, when the police tried to forcibly remove some demonstrators who were staging a sit-in. After that, the target shifted to the Ministry of the Interior, which is situated a couple of blocks off the square and serves as the headquarters for law enforcement in Egypt. By the third day of these new protests, tens of thousands had flocked to Tahrir, most of them young people who had not participated in the Islamists’ march. There was no larger organization that spoke for these demonstrators, who chanted slogans about freedom and democracy. The mosque was the only institution on Tahrir that remained open to the revolution. It was a sprawling stone building, big enough to house makeshift medical clinics, pharmacies, and storerooms. It had the only public bathrooms on the square, as well as electrical outlets. It became apparent that nobody was in charge. The imam was Sheikh Mazhar Shahin, who is a celebrity in Egypt. At the beginning of the violence he had made a high-profile attempt to broker peace, which failed. But during this period he never seemed to be at the mosque. It was hard to imagine what lessons the young people on Tahrir would take away from this stage of the revolution. Virtually everybody with authority—the imams and the politicians, the progressives and the fundamentalists—had washed their hands of the demonstrators. In the mosque, volunteers were overwhelmed, and they struggled to manage an institution that felt even more directionless than the country as a whole. And yet from a distance it was clear that the protests had served a valuable purpose. They reminded the Egyptians of the original goals of the Arab Spring, and they proved to the military and the political parties that there was still a deep wellspring of anger. Considering all the unrest, it was remarkable that the first round of the elections, which were held on the eleventh day of the protests, were civil and well organized.</p>
