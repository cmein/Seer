<p>What&#8217;s that smell?  It isn&#8217;t from fresh cookies out of the oven, but rather fresh grades posted to Penn InTouch!  Well when one Penngineer checked his grade, he was very disappointed by what he saw.  To find out where everything went wrong, he emailed not just his professor, <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2010/12/listserv-abusers-get-sassy/" target="_blank">but</a> <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2010/12/listserv-etiquette-101/" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/03/emails-do-less-edition/" target="_blank">entire</a> <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/12/how-to-beat-listserv-abuse-by-abusing-the-listserv/" target="_blank">class</a>.  Whoops!</p>

<p>Only after the professor responded and the student <s>continued begging</s> got more desperate did he realize that the entire class had seen the conversation&#8230; and all of his grade grubbing.</p>

<p>When our friend reached out to his classmates one last time, we&#8217;re pretty sure he was crossing his fingers that no one would do anything crazy with this, like <a href="mailto:tips@underthebutton.com" target="_blank">send it our way</a>!</p>
