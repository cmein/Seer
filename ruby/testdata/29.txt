<p><strong>Los Angeles (CNN)</strong> -- Los Angeles authorities released surveillance video showing a man they want to speak to in connection to a spate of wildfires in and around the city.</p>
<p>Michael Moriarty, a commander in the Los Angeles police department's detectives bureau, called the man on the video a "person of interest" in the investigation.</p>
<p>"We have video of this individual in two instances" directly tied to recent fires, he said Sunday night.</p>
<p>The video, only one of which was released, shows a man who appears to be in his late 20s to mid-30s and has a ponytail, receding hairline and dark hair.</p>
<p>"That person is out there, and we want to make sure that we apprehend him," city councilman Tom LaBonge said.</p>
<p>He said the fires are the work of an arsonist who struck "like lightning."</p>
<p>"There's nothing worse than something that can be prevented," the councilman said.</p>
<p>Earlier Sunday, fire officials said the number of fires believed to be linked to arson has risen to 39 across the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>A total of 32 fires have been set in Los Angeles and seven others in neighboring West Hollywood since Friday, Assistant Chief Patrick Butler of the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Seven of those fires occurred Saturday night, with one described as "significant," though only cars were damaged, fire officials said.</p>
<p>A joint task force made up of city, county fire officials and police departments is investigating the string of fires.</p>
<p>It includes about 25 personnel from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that spokesman Patrick Gorman said would be on the scene by Monday.</p>
<p>These personnel have "special experience to determine the cause and origin of fires," Gorman said.</p>
<p>Moriarty said the law enforcement officers "executed a search warrant" Sunday morning at a single-family residence.</p>
<p>"We interviewed a number of people, (but) we did not make any arrests," he said.</p>
<p>Despite a $60,000 reward, authorities had not made an arrest by Sunday. Police are asking residents in the area to bring forward any surveillance video from their properties that might show suspicious activity. Residents are also being encouraged to follow the "see something, say something" motto and report suspicious behavior to authorities.</p>
<p>Officials sought Sunday to show their commitment to finding the person or people behind the fires.</p>

<p>"We're not going to rest and we're going to put all the resources out there," Butler said.</p>
<p>They also asked residents to help deter the perpetrator by leaving porch lights on and locking their vehicles, as many of the fires were set using a car as the incendiary device.</p>
<p>"Auto fires, as soon as they get going, they get really hot, really fast," Butler said. "They essentially give off their own combustibles."</p>
<p>Some of the fires spread to nearby buildings, though no injuries have been reported. Among the homes damaged was one that was once occupied by The Doors frontman Jim Morrison.</p>
<p>"When you have millions of people living with millions of cars in these very dense neighborhoods, this is becoming a new form of domestic terrorism that really has got our community in a very bad spot," West Hollywood Mayor John J. Duran told CNN Saturday.</p>
