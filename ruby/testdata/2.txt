<p>The &#034;father of Lebanon&#034; was brutally murdered five years ago on Sunday. More than 1,000 kilograms of explosives ripped through Rafik Hariri&#039;s motorcade as it passed Beirut&#039;s sunny seaside.</p>
<p>Since the explosion that claimed the life of the former prime minister, there has been one major war with Israel, an internal conflict, protests, riots and thousands of opposition members sitting in the city&#039;s central square.</p>
<p>It has been hectic to say the least since the man so many regarded as a true &#034;nationalist&#034; was assassinated. One month after his death, millions took to the streets, naming a party and changing politics in Lebanon forever. They recently swept Hezbollah in national elections, shocking many, including most observers.</p>
<p>But all of it has, in the end, led to a calm within Lebanon that the region has not seen for years.</p>
<p>Saad Hariri, who in his younger years was considered more than a playboy than stately, has been exactly that - a statesmen. During the recent plane crash off the coast, he was one of the first to arrive at the airport, consoling families for hours.</p>
<p>He blamed Syria totally for his father&#039;s early death, and yet he visited the country - a move seen by many as a benchmark in the relationship between the two countries. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been center-stage in thawing the relationship between Syria and the world for more than a year now.</p>
<p>On his second visit to Damascus, he snuck away with Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad to have dinner in the old city. The two are said by close aids to get along very well.</p>
<p>The American delegation trying to maintain some calm in the region has been led by former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, and while he has visited Beirut a few times, so has the head of Hamas: Khaled Meshaal. Meshaal also recently had a meeting with the head of Hezbollah, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah.</p>
<p>According to Israel: that&#039;s two of the world&#039;s biggest terrorists sitting in one room.</p>
<p>Hariri, who is proving slowly to be exactly what his father was trying to be, a nationalist pragmatist, has given Hezbollah the room they need to arm. The government&#039;s mission statement reforms the Shia militia group&#039;s right as &#034;the resistance.&#034; Critics say it allows Hezbollah to have weapons, while advocates say it allows them to have them in a &#034;defensive&#034; purpose.</p>
<p>The simple fact is both sides have violated the UN resolution that ended the 2006 war. Hezbollah is re-arming and Israel is flying over southern Lebanon. Neither side is taking great care to hide it. Israel shows the pictures of its flights to the world as evidence that Hezbollah is re-arming; something the resolution forbids it from doing.</p>
<p>The question then remains Israel. In recent weeks, the Israeli government has been stutter-stepping while rattling the Lebanese cage with words of war.</p>
<p>Israel&#039;s Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has been the most outspoken, saying at an Israeli university, &#034;Whoever thinks territorial concessions will disconnect Syria from the axis of evil is mistaken.... We must make Syria recognize that just as it relinquished its dream of a greater Syria that controls Lebanon.&#034;</p>
<p>According to Lebanon minister Yossi Peled, &#034;We are heading toward a new confrontation in the north, but I don&#039;t know when it will happen, just as we did not know when the second Lebanon war would erupt,&#034; across Israel on Army radio.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has been accusing Hezbollah of re-arming, but has also been walking his government back from the stringent talk of confrontation saying Israel seeks &#034;peace with its neighbors.&#034;</p>
<p>War in Lebanon is discussed everyday on almost every street corner. Everyone has an opinion and most are shared openly. But predicting a war with Israel is a fool&#039;s errand. No one saw the war in 2006, and no one will see the next one - if there is one.</p>
<p>For five years, everything in Lebanon has been about affiliation and not necessarily race or religion - some of the things that have separated Lebanon in the past ... but politics. Which party are you a supporter of? Whose flag do you carry to rallies? It&#039;s partly why people were shooting each other in the streets during May 2008. Every year, rallies like the one this year been about a political movement.</p>
<p>Maybe the dream of a father&#039;s son will be realized and this year, it will be about Lebanon.</p>
