<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>FOOD: These two Penn projects put the &#8220;nom&#8221; in Economy.</em></span><br />
<a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/08/is-that-a-grill-in-your-pocket/" target="_blank"><strong>Pocket Grill</strong></a>: This <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/192547389/pocket-grilltm-the-worlds-most-compactible-grill" target="_blank">little guy</a> is a great conversation piece for any camping trip. Arguably more important, it&#8217;s also a great cooking piece for any camping trip.<br />
<a href="http://uwaved.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Î¼Wave</strong></a>: This <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/11/penns-been-getting-techcrunched/" target="_blank">PennApps hack champ</a> is a microwave that plays YouTube videos. If you&#8217;re listening to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCIBksDfxBU&amp;ob=av3e" target="_blank">dubstep</a>, though, it&#8217;s basically just a regular microwave then.<br />

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ENGINEERING: In between complaining about their midterms and posting on LikeALittle, these kids actually turn out some impressive stuff.</span><br />
</em><strong>Penn GRASP Labs</strong>: What <em>hasn&#8217;t</em> this Penngineering robotics department done in the past year? Thanks to these folks, robots will soon be stealing thousands of jobs from real Amurricans, ranging from <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/04/go-go-gadget-robot-pitcher/" target="_blank">baseball pitching</a> and <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/07/grasp-scores-the-goald/" target="_blank">soccer playing</a>, to <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/10/robot-watch-the-poop-scoop/" target="_blank">pooper-scooping</a> and <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/05/if-r2-d2-and-c-3po-had-a-baby/" target="_blank">housekeeping</a>. (And for that matter, what will Olga and Consuela do?)<em><br />
</em><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/06/penn-grads-charge-forward/" target="_blank"><strong>uBeam</strong></a>: Developed by two College grads (gasp!), this ultrasound remote charging device has been <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/08/ubeamakin-it-big/" target="_blank">making headlines</a> all over the place, even earning one of its founders a <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/12/penn-alum-makes-forbes-30-under-30-list/" target="_blank">mention in <em>Forbes</em></a>.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONLINE: It&#8217;s where we spend 90% of our time, so why not make it enjoyable?</span><br />

<a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/07/have-you-created-your-startup-yet-this-summer/" target="_blank"><strong>Smartling</strong></a>: This fun app lets you give Babelfish a rest while it translates webpages for you. Wonder if its technology can also be applied to the Language Requirement&#8230;</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MAKING A DIFFERENCE: Who says business is just about making money?</span><br />
<strong>Kinecthesia</strong>: </em>These Penn hacks reprogrammed a Windows Kinect and made it into a trendy belt to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/14/students-hack-the-kinect-to-allow-blind-to-navigate/" target="_blank">help allow the blind to navigate</a>. And then spoke to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhPIvC7Hjs8&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">Chelsea Clinton</a> about it!<br />
<a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/12/wharton-visionaries/" target="_blank"><strong>Warby Parker</strong></a>: This eyewear company is on a mission to not only sell glasses on the cheap, but also to distribute free pairs to those who can&#8217;t afford &#8216;em.
