<p><strong>Lahore, Pakistan</strong> - No one who has ever driven in Karachi will doubt when one of it’s residents claims to have been stuck in traffic. When gridlock clamps the city in it’s sweaty, seething, steely grip it’s as if the key has been thrown away.</p>

<p>So we weren’t just relieved when H.M. Naqvi our guest arrived, we were also secretly thankful he’d spared us the painful commute to his place.</p>
<p>He is instantly a refreshing breath of what makes Pakistan so tantalizingly exotic. Pale blue suit, white shirt unbuttoned fashionably low and a smoky voice that revels in every intellectual syllable he speaks.</p>
<p>Naqvi had come to talk to us about his debut novel, &#034;Home Boy,&#034; a coming of age of a young Pakistani growing up in post 9/11 New York. A few days earlier he’d been shocked to receive an e-mail from an unknown reader who told him to turn on the news and pay attention.</p>
<p>As he watched he learned what millions of Pakistani around the world were just grappling with. The man accused of trying to blow up his SUV in Times Square was a Pakistani.</p>
<p>For Naqvi the shock didn’t stop there, the alleged bomber had much in common with his protagonist.</p>
<p>When I explain this is what I want to discuss, not just his fictional characters but the real life drama his country is caught up in I see a tiny hint of discomfort. It’s not what he’s expecting.</p>
<p>Six months on the talk circuit launching his widely acclaimed book is not the perfect preparation for a more wide-ranging discourse and he admits it. He is very cool about it but warns me I’ll be taking him out of his comfort zone.</p>
<p>He needn’t have worried, he ranges effortlessly over a landscape topics often taboo in polite circles here. He is frank and honest, but it is in the depth of his discourse he is most revealing.</p>
<p>His thoughts have a clarity that can only have been achieved through the intense distillation a first novel demands. Each facet of his own, and his protagonists lives, held up for close scrutiny and understanding.</p>
<p>Throughout our conversation Naqvi is both optimistic and realistic in equal measure. He is the voice of the silent majority. As much as his novel is compelling his take on the real world away from fiction is a fascinating insight in to his deeply troubled country.</p>
