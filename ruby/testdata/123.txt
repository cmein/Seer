The improved security situation means a few ordinary Iraqis are once again taking the time to relax with their families and friends by the water.</div><br /><div>Baghdad correspondent Arwa Damon sent me these pictures of a story she shot for <em>Inside the Middle East</em>.</div><br /><div>Arwa writes:<em> "The Habbaniye Resort was once allegedly voted “best resort in the Middle East.” Sanction began its initial decline into decay, and after the 2003 US-led invasion, it deteriorated completely. Surprisingly, even though it is located between Ramadi and Falluja in what was Al Qaeda’s heartland, it was never over run by insurgents – the employees defended the place. Today, tour buses run from Baghdad, taking Iraqis on day trips to the lakeside; but it is a shadow of what it was."</em></div><div><em></em></div><div><br />The sandy waterfront is littered with trash (picture 2) and the once chic reception area of the resort (picture 3) is still abandoned and damaged.</div><div></div><div><br />Arwa says of the couple in the middle picture: <em>"Ahmed and his wife – a young couple from Baghdad, making their first trip with 38 other family members. He married her after her father – his best friend – was gunned down. They do believe that Iraq will be a place where they can raise a family."</em></div><div><em></em></div><div><br />Check out Arwa's story on the Habbaniye resort on this month's edition of <em>Inside the Middle east.</em></div></div></div>
