<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- Former World No.1 Lleyton Hewitt put up a battling display before losing in three sets to Spain's Fernando Verdasco at the Hopman Cup in Perth Sunday,</p>
<p>Home hope Hewitt has not played in four months due to a major foot problem, but came close to beating the high-rated Verdasco before he prevailed 6-3 3-6 7-5 in just over two hours.</p>
<p>Two-time grand slam winner Hewitt is in the autumn of his glittering career but the 30-year-old has ruled out retirement despite slipping to 186 in the rankings.</p>
<p>"I feel pretty good at the moment," Hewitt told gathered reporters after he and Jarmila Gajdosova had lost the deciding mixed doubles to Verdasco and Anabel Medina Garrigues.</p>
<p>Gajdosova beat Medina Garrigues 6-3 3-6 6-3 in the opening match before Verdasco leveled the tie.</p>
<p>The Spaniards then survived a match point to win a thrilling deciding mixed doubles in a tiebreak 3-6 6-3 11-9.</p>
<p>Despite a pair of close defeats, it was an encouraging return for Hewitt, who has not played since losing in a Davis Cup tie for Australia in September.</p>
<p>"Lleyton is a very tough player," Verdasco told the official tournament website. "He always fights until the end. He played really well, I was playing well. I think and I hope he will have a good 2012,"</p>
<p>The mixed team event has attracted a strong field, with women's No.2 Petra Kvitova joining Tomas Berdych in a strong Czech team, while French Open champion Li Na is playing for China.</p>
<p>She paired with Wu Di to go down to a 2-1 defeat Saturday to France, who are represented by Richard Gasquet and Marion Bartoli.</p>
