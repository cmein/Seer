<p>Athens, Greece - Angry protest turned to tragedy on Athens&#039; streets today.</p>
<p>Demonstrators threw a petrol bomb into the Marfin Egnantia Bank in Central Athens. Three employees were killed in the blaze, two women and a man. The civil protection ministry just told us that one of the women was pregnant.</p>
<p>Outside crowds watched the firemen work, as riot police guarded the water-drenched remains of the building&#039;s ground floor. Protesters threw bottles at them. &#034;Liars, torturers,&#034; they shouted.</p>
<p>&#034;I don&#039;t believe anyone was killed,&#034; one demonstrator told me. &#034;I&#039;ll believe it when I see it.&#034;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister George Papandreou issued a statement. &#034;Protest is one thing, murder another,&#034; he said. He vowed to bring those responsible to justice. Outside the parliament building, graffiti sprayed on the ground read &#034;George get out.&#034;</p>
<p>We spent the early part of the morning with Alexandra Lekka, a secondary school teacher who stands to lose 150 euros a month from the new austerity measures.</p>
<p>I just called her, to find out her reaction to the killings. &#034;I cannot breathe. We are all frozen now,&#034; she said. &#034;Everybody is very sad and very angry. I don&#039;t know what is going to happen.&#034;</p>
<p>I am often asked on air how this mess will resolve itself. It is a question the Greek people, the Greek government, EU leaders and the financial markets don&#039;t have an answer to. Now Greek society is not just angry but traumatized. It is a terrible combination.</p>
