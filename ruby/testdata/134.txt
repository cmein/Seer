<p style="text-align:left;">Seven in the morning. my phone rings: a text message from the International Solidarity Movement, which describes itself as a &#034;Palestinian-led organization committed to resisting the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land using nonviolent, direct-action methods and principles.&#034;</p>
<p>The text message reads: &#034;Israeli bulldozers leveling and uprooting land in al-Walaja village south of Jerusalem for the planned route construction of the separation wall.&#034;</p>
<p>Grabbing my cameras and tripod I got in the car and headed to the Palestinian village of al-Walaja.</p>
<p>After reaching the village I walked for five minutes until I came upon the site of construction of what Israel calls its security barrier and what Palestinians and many international activists call an apartheid wall.</p>
<p>Here I saw two dozen activists trying to force their way past Israeli soldiers and border police in an effort to prevent earth moving equipment from laying foundations for the construction of the wall.</p>
<p>Activists say that they are protesting at this site because the path the wall is on is Palestinian-owned farm land and will separate the village from the fields and isolate al-Walaja from the rest of the West Bank and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Israel says it is constructing the separation wall to protect its citizens from suicide bombers and other attacks. Palestinians consider the construction of an Israeli separation wall a land grab</p>
<p>At first the Israeli soldiers and border police formed a security barrier preventing some journalists and activists from getting close to the construction site.</p>
<p>But the activists managed to elude the soldiers and border police and reach the construction site where large bulldozers where leveling and uprooting the hill top of the village farm land to make way for the wall.</p>
<p>As I was following the activists I heard loud shouting and saw three soldiers subduing a Palestinian teenager who was trying to prevent the movement of the bulldozers.</p>
<p>Three soldiers wrestled the teenager to the ground and used pepper spray before cuffing him and placing him under arrest</p>
<p>During this time a handful of activists managed to form a human chain in front of a large bulldozer. With their arms locked together the activists shouted slogans and refused to follow orders of an Israeli military commander to voluntarily leave the area.</p>
<p>The activist refused to move and demanded to see paperwork denying them access to the area. No such document was handed over by the Israeli commander and minutes later Israeli soldiers and border police started dragging the activists one-by-one from in front of the bulldozers.</p>
<p>Undeterred, the activists tried to get in front of the bulldozer again, but met more Israeli police and soldiers who had formed their own human chain blocking accessing to the site.</p>
<p>This is the third time protests have been staged with the aim of stopping construction of the wall in the Palestinian village of al-Walaja. The activists have pledged to keep coming back despite the poor odds of stopping construction of the wall.</p>
