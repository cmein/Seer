<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- Serena Williams has revealed she is not in love with playing tennis, despite an impressive straight sets victory on her return to action at the Brisbane International tournament.</p>
<p>Playing in her first match since losing the U.S. Open final to Samantha Stosur in September, Williams brushed aside South African Chanelle Scheepers 6-2 6-3 with consummate ease.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old American, who is seeded fourth in Brisbane, fired down seven aces in a 68-minute victory -- but later told reporters that she will cut back her schedule even further in 2012.</p>
<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/01/sport/tennis/tennis-brisbane-clijsters-serena/index.html?hpt=ite_t1">Clijsters returns with convincing victory</a></p>
<p>"I just want to be able to do other things that I'm doing and expand on that. I think that helps keep my motivation up," said the 13-time grand slam winner.</p>

<p>"I don't love tennis today but I'm here. I can't live without it -- there's a difference between not loving something and not being able to live without it.</p>
<p>"It's not that I've fallen out of love with it. I've actually never liked sports and I never understood how I became an athlete," Williams continued.</p>
<p>"I don't like working out, I don't like anything physical. If it involves sitting down or shopping, I'm excellent at it."</p>
<p>In other matches, top seed and local favorite Stosur beat Anastasiya Yakimova of Belarus 6-2 6-3 and is on course to face Williams again in the semifinals.</p>
<p>Second seed Andrea Petkovic of Germany defeated Israeli Shahar Peer 7-6 1-6 6-3, while former world number one Ana Ivanovic saw off Austrian Tamira Paszek 6-3 6-3 and now faces Kim Clijsters.</p>
