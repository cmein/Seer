<p>It was 3 a.m. in Los Angeles when I got the call from the office: The Polish President had been killed in a plane crash in Russia. That is all we knew at that point. When I put the phone down I thought it was a dream, but I checked the phone again and realized it wasn&#039;t. Needless to say, I couldn&#039;t sleep. There were so many unanswered questions.</p>

<p>I was on my way to Warsaw on the first flight out of L.A. By the morning I had learned that the president had been on his way with 95 others onboard to Katyn to mark the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre. Some of Poland&#039;s most influential politicians and intellectual elite were killed in the crash in this same place where 20,000 officers and members of the Polish intelligentia had perished in 1940.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Warsaw Sunday I was hit by a sea of candles and flowers and thousands of Poles paying homage to their President Lech Kaczynski and the others who had been on board. My family is from Warsaw. I have been going there my whole life. This time, however, it was not the city that I remember. The somber mood of a country in grieving was overwhelming. We spent the next six days in Warsaw, and when the bodies of the president and his wife came back to Poland and were placed in the presidential palace for the public to pay their last respects; the doors stayed open until his body was taken away.</p>
<p>Thousands of Poles from all over the country came to pay their respects and waited in line for hours, some of them overnight. It seemed that that no matter what their political stance, they had found a common voice and had united in sorrow and mourning.</p>
<p>The week of mourning for the victims of the crash ended with an emotional state funeral in Krakow Sunday. Not everyone in Poland was in agreement over the place of burial.</p>
<p>The crypt at the Wawel Castle is a resting place reserved for kings and national heroes. Not everyone here is in agreement over the decision to bury the president and first lady there. They made their thoughts known on Thursday in a demonstration protesting this choice, chanting “To Powaski (a cemetery in Warsaw), not to the Wawel” and “Don’t make a martyr out of the president.”</p>
<p>Protests are not unusual in Poland. My personal experience is that a Pole will most likely let you know what they think, and this wasn&#039;t an exception despite a week of mourning.</p>
<p>Despite the fact many international dignitaries couldn&#039;t make the funeral because of the volcanic ash fallout - another unlucky blow for the country/ I mean what are the chances? – Poles still came en masse.</p>
<p>We broadcast live from the heart of the 50,000-strong main square, the only foreign network in the crowd. One man told me, “I feel pain, an enormous emptiness because our beloved president died, and we are so sad. We can’t seem to find ourselves.”</p>
<p>People cried openly as the coffins were taken away, and there was an air of silent disbelief.</p>
<p>Katyn, where my grandmother&#039;s brother was killed and a subject I have heard about my whole life, was largely unknown to the world before this tragic accident and a contentious subject for the Poles.</p>
<p>I have heard many say that however tragic this accident is, it did do one thing: It did bring Katyn to the world.</p>
