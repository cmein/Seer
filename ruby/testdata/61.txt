<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> -- Arab League monitors remain in Syria, and more are on the way, a top official with the Arab body said, despite a call by an Arab League advisor to pull the observers out.</p>
<p>An advance team of monitors returned to Cairo on Sunday after 10 days in the violence-wracked country, but the main body of observers remains in Syria, said the official, who asked not to be named discussing diplomatic business.</p>
<p>The team that has returned is preparing a report which should be released soon, said the official, speaking late on Sunday.</p>
<p>Arab League observers went into Syria in December after the United Nations estimated that 5,000 people had been killed since March in an uprising against the government.</p>

<p>President Bashar al-Assad's government says it is cracking down on armed terrorists.</p>
<p>The head of an advisory board to the Arab League called Sunday for the withdrawal of observers from Syria, claiming the mission has allowed Syrian officials to continue a brutal crackdown on protesters.</p>
<p>"What is happening allows the Syrian regime a cover for the exercise of its inhumane practices under the Arab League's watch," Ali Salem al-Deqbasi said in a statement, according to Egypt's state-run MENA news agency.</p>
<p>Al-Deqbasi heads the Arab Parliament, an advisory board to the Cairo-based Arab League.</p>
<p>The Arab League has not scheduled a meeting to discuss al-Deqbasi's statement, the Arab League source said.</p>
<p>As the fact-finding mission continued Sunday, at least 10 people were killed in Syria, according to an opposition activist group.</p>
<p>Three people died in Hama, four were killed in Homs, two were killed in the Damascus suburb of Daraya and one was killed in Idlib, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The organization said a child was among its tally of "martyrs," but did not provide additional information.</p>
<p>Since Arab League monitors entered Syria, the LCC said Sunday that it had documented the deaths of 315 people, including 24 children.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the state-run Syrian Arab News agency said Sunday that the bodies of 21 troops "killed in the line of duty by armed terrorist groups" were taken from military hospitals to their final resting places.</p>
<p>CNN cannot independently verify accounts of violence or reports of deaths and injuries in Syria because al-Assad's government has restricted journalists from working freely in the country.</p>
<p>In mid-March, al-Assad began a crackdown on anti-government protesters calling for his ouster. The Syrian government has repeatedly blamed "armed terrorist groups" for violence during the uprising.</p>
<p>The LCC, which has a network of contacts across Syria, said that more than 5,800 people were killed in 2011 during the crackdown on opposition protests.</p>
<p>A number of amateur videos posted online have surfaced purporting to show Arab League observers since the group arrived in Syria last week.</p>
<p>One video posted Friday purported to show residents of the southwestern city of Daraa telling a monitor about a man who they said had been a victim of torture.</p>
<p>Another video purported to show that same monitor saying he had witnessed snipers firing in the city, which has been a flashpoint for clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the head of the Arab League monitors' mission said observers had not seen sniper attacks.</p>
<p>"We are monitoring the alleged presence of snipers on buildings, but (there is) no evidence of that yet," said Lt. Gen. Mohamed Ahmed Mustafa al-Dabi.</p>
<p>The Arab League, the United States, the European Union and Turkey have condemned the government crackdown and initiated sanctions. But Russia and China have stood in the way of a strong U.N. Security Council resolution toward the Syrian government.</p>
<p>Last month, al-Assad agreed to a peace initiative with the Arab League that calls for security forces to withdraw from cities, release detainees and end violence. Part of the agreement calls for Arab League observers to monitor whether the government abides by the initiative.</p>
