<p>At a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/09/sports/baseball/grief-and-questions-after-death-at-ballpark.html?scp=1&amp;sq=texas%20rangers%20father%20son&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">baseball game</a> in Texas, a father reaches for a tossed ball, flips over a safety rail, and falls to his death before the eyes of his six-year-old son. On the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/12/world/europe/12russia.html?ref=europe" target="_blank">Volga River</a> in Russia, a mother fights her way out of a sinking pleasure boat and loses her grip on the hand of her ten-year-old daughter, who joins dozens of other children in the depths.</p><p>Nolan Ryan, owner of the Texas Rangers, said that the rails had passed the safety test and there were no immediate plans to change them. Ryan added, “I think what baseball has done is they want to try to make the experience at the ballpark as memorable as possible for our fans and for them to connect as much as they can with our players. I’m no different than our fan base. When I was younger and went to the ballpark, my hope was to get a foul ball. We’re about making memories, about family entertainment and last night we had a father and a son at the game and had a very tragic incident. It just drives to the core of what we’re about, and the memories we try to make in this game for our fans.” What does this mean? I can’t tell and don’t want to know, but it proves that Ryan, a pitching legend, was wise to let his arm do the talking during his twenty-seven-year career. In Moscow, Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian President, was more direct: “We have far too many old ships sailing our waters. Just because up until now nothing had gone wrong did not mean that this kind of tragedy could not happen. It has happened now, and with the most terrible consequences.” If this sounds startling, it’s because we’re not used to officials talking without regard to ridicule and lawsuits.</p><div id="entry-more">
<p>These were not “acts of god,” but the culpability is diffuse. The Rangers could have raised the rails after previous incidents. The Russians could have docked their unseaworthy vessels. Both tragedies were freakish and also, in their way, preventable, but now it’s too late. You don’t have to be a parent to find them intolerable, but it helps.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the news <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/world/middleeast/13baghdad.html?hp" target="_blank">from Iraq</a> is that a man who risked his life to work as an interpreter for the American military is denied a U.S. visa despite a dozen letters from officers testifying to his bravery and decency. No reason given, which, when you think about it, is worse than a statement from Nolan Ryan. This interpreter is far from alone. A few years ago, Congress mandated that five thousand special immigrant visas be issued annually to Iraqis and Afghans with ties to the U.S. government. So far this year, the number actually issued is around two hundred and forty; in June, zero. Perhaps because of charges against an Iraqi couple in Kentucky, the gates, having been pushed slightly open for a few years, have all but closed. Which is about where things stood back in 2007, when people first started calling attention to this scandal. Tim Arango’s story in the <em>Times</em> makes very familiar reading.</p>
<p>I’m also familiar with the official reason: security. This was the official reason in 2007, and 2008, and 2009. It’s like being told that the rails met the safety code. I also understand the non-official reason: this issue helps nobody but the Iraqis concerned, gets no one elected, is the lowest possible priority for most harried and worried bureaucrats, and could be detrimental to someone’s career if things happen to go wrong. Does it matter that there are good people inside government, in the White House and the State Department, who care about the issue? If the number of visas is zero, then I can’t see that it makes much difference. In my experience on this issue, the only thing that makes a difference is leadership—and if it comes from the top, then all the better.</p>
<p>So here is another preventable tragedy for which culpability is diffuse. But unlike the ones in Texas and Russia, the one in Iraq is ongoing. In a sense, it has not even happened yet, not to its fullest extent. This means that, unlike Nolan Ryan and Dmitry Medvedev, President Obama has the good fortune of still being able to save some lives. But not for long. An Iraqi who works for the U.S., and who spent the month of May in hiding after getting a threat, told Arango that, after the last American units leave later this year, “it’s going to be the worst time for those people who worked for the Americans.” This man has been waiting on his visa request since 2009. And yet the Obama Administration has done no reckoning, no list-gathering, no contingency planning. Just as time runs out on these Iraqis, the doors have slammed in their faces.</p>
<p>In the next few years, American soldiers will also leave Afghanistan, where this issue has been almost ignored. Not long ago, I got a letter from a doctor whose best friend from med school is deployed with the Air Force: “He’s having a bit of a tough time over there—most of his cases are Afghan civilians and many of them are kids caught in the crossfire. This is tough stuff even for jaded doctors and soldiers, as you know from covering this stuff. He was also telling me about a rash of cases where the Taliban has been executing people they suspect of being collaborators in bullet-to-the-back-of-the-head fashion. In one case he was actually able to save a young man, but was struggling with what will become of this neurologically impaired man when the U.S. is gone in a year or two.”</p>
