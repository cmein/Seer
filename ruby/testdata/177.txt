<p class="descender">It was a sunny Monday in mid-December when Newt Gingrich arrived in the cafeteria of L-3 Warrior Systems, in New Hampshire. Because the company is technologically sophisticated, labor-intensive, military-affiliated, and close to the Manchester airport, it is an enticing venue for Presidential candidates. In honor of Gingrich’s visit, the tables had been removed, and the chairs were lined up in rows. A few months earlier, a Gingrich visit might not have required any rearrangement of the furniture: in June, after a slow and frustrating start to the campaign, most of his top staffers quit, and pundits couldn’t believe that Gingrich didn’t have the sense to quit, too. But in October, after a series of feisty debate performances, his poll numbers started improving; in late November he was endorsed by the New Hampshire <em>Union Leader</em>, the state’s largest newspaper; and by the time he arrived at L-3 Warrior Systems he was leading in the national polls. He was thrilled by his comeback, though not surprised. “I’m now, I think by a big margin, the front-runner,” he said, and he passed a pleasant half hour telling the assembled employees and reporters about his plans to debate President Obama into ignominy, thereby clearing the way for a transformative Gingrich Administration.</p>
<p>Gingrich has been a national political figure for more than thirty years, although he sees himself as a historian. He has a Ph.D. from Tulane, and was a history and environmental-studies professor at West Georgia College in the nineteen-seventies; he still has a knack, common to effective teachers, for making his listeners feel smart for keeping up with his train of thought. He speaks in a soft tenor, often tucking his chin and leaning toward his interlocutor—if he wore glasses, he would be constantly peering over them. When he arrived in Washington, in 1979, he was a new kind of Southern conservative. He represented Georgia’s Sixth District, the wealthiest in the state, and he combined the expected denunciations of the “corrupt liberal welfare state” with unexpected paeans to the emancipatory powers of information technology and galactic exploration. In 1984, Gingrich published a manifesto, “Window of Opportunity,” which has on its cover a space shuttle and a bald eagle; its author is advertised as “Chairman of the Congressional Space Caucus.” The preface, by the science-fiction writer Jerry Pournelle, declared, “It’s raining soup, and Newt Gingrich has the blueprints for soup bowls.”</p>
<p>A less original politician, or a humbler one, might have assumed that fierce partisan invective was incompatible with futuristic policy proposals. But Gingrich saw that these two kinds of provocation, combined, could form the basis of a crafty political strategy: the more sharply he criticized liberalism, the more freedom he had to depart from conservative orthodoxy. He described himself as a leader of a band of nuanced partisans. “We’re post-New Deal conservatives, not anti-New Deal conservatives,” he said.</p>
<p>Even by Washington standards, Gingrich was a rough infighter. He assailed the first President Bush for raising taxes, and, through ruthless maneuvering and a brilliant reinvention of congressional fund-raising practices, he engineered a Republican takeover of Congress: in 1995, he became the first Republican Speaker of the House in almost half a century. He presided over four tempestuous but productive congressional sessions—he was, he says, “fortunate” to be paired with President Clinton, and they collaborated to reform welfare and to balance the federal budget. But by 1998, when he announced his resignation, Gingrich had alienated many of his Republican allies, and his personal unpopularity probably hurt the Party in that year’s elections. When he returned to the campaign trail, after a highly remunerative decade in private life, he seemed remarkably unchanged: he is now sixty-eight, but he speaks and thinks with the same itchy impatience that charmed and horrified Washington in the nineteen-eighties.</p>
<p>When Gingrich finished his speech at L-3, he took a few questions and then allowed himself to be set upon by reporters. Someone asked about a recent statement from Mitt Romney, the protean former governor of Massachusetts, and a founder of Bain Capital, the private-equity firm. Ever since the race began, Romney has been the favorite, although he hasn’t inspired too much favor; the number of Republicans who expect him to win the nomination surely dwarfs the number who want him to win it. A few hours earlier and a few miles away, at a homespun Manchester restaurant called Chez Vachon, which is known for its poutine, Romney had criticized Gingrich for accepting nearly two million dollars in consulting fees from Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage company. Romney said that Gingrich was part of the “Washington crowd of insiders,” and he agreed when the interviewer suggested that Gingrich return the money.</p>
<p>As Gingrich listened to a reporter explaining Romney’s latest affront, he smiled like a boy about to unwrap a Christmas present. “I would just say that if Governor Romney would like to give back all the money he’s earned from bankrupting companies and laying off employees over his years at Bain, that I would be glad to then listen to him,” Gingrich said.</p>
<p>Like many of Gingrich’s best lines, this one was pithy and, upon examination, somewhat puzzling. In buying and restructuring ailing companies, hadn’t Romney practiced precisely the sort of creative destruction that markets demand and conservatives celebrate? If Bain’s profits were illegitimate, which other corporate profits might be illegitimate, too? Never mind: as members of the media were busy turning the Romney-Gingrich feud into the day’s big story, the candidate was speeding south to Hollis, where he was scheduled to make an appearance at a local pharmacy. There he took some questions in front of a Yankee Candle display and examined a pair of parrots. Gingrich has retained his childhood fascination with animals; in his recent book “A Nation Like No Other,” he includes zoos in his list of “civic-minded institutions” that make America great. He headed to the parking lot, shaking hands and accepting encouragement, while ignoring a man who was pressing him about his Israel policy. A few days earlier, Gingrich had referred dismissively to the “invented Palestinian people”; it was hard to tell whether this was loose talk or a dramatic diplomatic stratagem or both.</p>
