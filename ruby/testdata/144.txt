<p><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/10/saturday-night-special-fire-burning-harnwell-remix/" target="_blank">Fire Burning (Harnwell Remix)</a> </strong><em>by 2403 Productions<br />
</em>When you mix club music with the wonderful lullaby of college house fire alarms, you come out with a tune that offers a ton of functionality.  Scaring away an annoying hallmate is <s>definitely</s> maybe an option.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/06/rossman-rocks-it-out/" target="_blank">Rock It Out</a> </strong><em>by Rossman<br />
</em>This is the hit that started it all!  Produced and performed by Penn students, this music video features Philly landmarks and clips from a party in the Quad, and by a party in the Quad we actually mean Fling.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/08/adrenaline-junkie/" target="_blank">Adrenaline</a></strong> <em>by Nick Mishkin<br />
</em>We are awarding 2011 <em>UTB</em> bucks for a music video filmed at Smoke&#8217;s but subtracting 2012 because it&#8217;s not the only video filmed at Smoke&#8217;s that made it to our list.</p>
<p><span id="more-37997"></span><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/10/which-one/" target="_blank">Crushin&#8217;</a></strong> <em>by Danielle Golub<br />
</em>&amp; <strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/10/which-one/" target="_blank">Someone Like You Cover</a></strong><em> by Kim Adams<br />
</em>The next two hits on our list were faced off in a poll earlier this semester where the recent 2011 grad, Adams, beat out UA Freshman, Golub, where the winner received the honor of a new bathroom toilet seat to use for her next YouTube cover.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/11/adorable-freshman-plays-nintendo-tunes-will-make-it-big-someday/" target="_blank">Nintendo Mario Theme</a></strong><em> by Mike Choi<br />
</em>We&#8217;ll never forget watching this adorable little freshman blowing his&#8230; piano.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/11/blarney-stone-is-dtf/" target="_blank">DTF</a></strong><em> by Sos and Soda<br />
</em>Separating themselves from the other random music videos filmed at Penn, Sos and Soda chose to feature Blarney Stone over Smoke&#8217;s for this raunchy gem.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/11/red-giants-releases-ep/" target="_blank">Red Giant</a></strong><em> by Red Giants<br />
</em>A group featuring six Penn students released a pretty good EP before SPEC Concerts Penn Music Collective event last semester.  What&#8217;s better than a &#8220; luminous ball of hydrogen, carbon and helium in a late stage of stellar evolution&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/12/let-it-go-mazzerati-rick/" target="_blank">Let It Go</a> </strong><em>by Mazzerati Rick<br />
</em>Filmed in its entirety at Smoke&#8217;s, this video is basically Jersey Shore: Penn.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/01/homegrown-celebrity-spotlight-etan-fraser/" target="_blank">Go Time</a></strong><em> by ETAN<br />
</em>Probably the most successful music video on this list, &#8220;Go Time&#8221; was produced by 2011 grad Etan Fraser and was featured on MTV and BET.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/04/med-students-app-takes-the-instrument-out-of-playing-an-instrument/" target="_blank">Just The Way You Are Cover</a></strong><em> by Tim Soo<br />
</em>There&#8217;s an app for that!  Soo, a Penn med student, performed his cover using an iPhone and Wiimote using his new invisible instrument app.  While we don&#8217;t see Soo&#8217;s cover hitting the <em>Billboard</em> charts anytime soon, its a pretty remarkable accomplishment and a great way to end our list.</p>
