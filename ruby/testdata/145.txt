Pickles are tasty.&#8221;</p>
<p>With 2011 drawing to a close, we decided to reflect on the year&#8217;s best food-related openings, WTF moments and generally awesome occurrences around campus. How many were there? A lot. So many, in fact, that we must warn you before you begin reading: we had to make a list of lists. Please excuse this trite homage to Inception, and focus instead on the following drool-worthy remembrances:</p>
<p><strong>New Noms On The Block</strong></p>
<p><em>Food Trucks, Fancified&#8211; </em>With the entrance of intellects-turned-health nuts <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/09/brain-food/" target="_blank">Chez Yasmine</a> and locavore-centric <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/09/magic-carpet-meet-your-match/" target="_blank">Pure Fare</a>, we can only speculate what 2012 will mean for the future of our favorite mobile meals (Reservations required? Black-tie optional? Real silverware? JK, ha ha, not a chance).<span id="more-37949"></span></p>
<p><em>Inside Jobs&#8211; </em>If you were lucky enough to live in the quad this year, you got to experience its <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/08/live-from-the-new-quad-dining-hall/" target="_blank">revamped dining hall</a> (made newsworthy only by the collective sigh of every upperclassman with memories of McClelland&#8217;s soggy Sunday brunch). This year also saw the opening of <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/10/looking-inside-schaye-cafe/" target="_blank">Schaye Café</a> inside the School of Social Policy and Practice&#8217;s Caster Buildling&#8211; and thus a reason to actually go inside.</p>
<p><em>Other&#8211; </em>In what may have been the biggest blow to Gia since the bomb threat (discussed later in this post), <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/04/sweetgreen-has-arrived/" target="_blank">Sweetgreen</a> opened, stealing the spotlight and at least 50% of all lin-dins. And adding to the wildly contagious brunch craze, <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/06/sabrinas-to-cast-a-spell-over-ucity/" target="_blank">Sabrina&#8217;s</a> set up shop at 34th and Powelton, prompting thousands (millions?) of muploads of stuffed french toast. Seriously, guys, we&#8217;ve seen enough.</p>
<p><strong>Things That Made Us Go WTF</strong></p>
<p><em>Uncommonly Common&#8211; </em>This was a big year for Commons. First, <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/02/tragedy-of-the-commons/" target="_blank">this sausage (?)-cum-turd</a>, then this arguably inedible, <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/12/shutterbutton-would-you-eat-this-apple/" target="_blank">half-fermented apple</a>? At least they keep us on our toes? So many questions.</p>
<p><em>One Of These Things Is Not Like The Others&#8211; </em>Remember that one time <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/09/metrohmygod/" target="_blank">a dragonfly</a> got tossed into Metro&#8217;s salad? Yeah, we&#8217;d prefer not to, either. Also, <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/02/sweet-decorations/" target="_blank">this cookie</a> that was temporarily nailed to KCECH&#8217;s bulletin board will be a constant reminder that, HEY FRESHMEN&#8211; you have even more meals to waste next semester, so give them to us.</p>
<p><em>For Real Or For Fake?&#8211; </em>This year also left us wondering if maybe, after all, the joke&#8217;s on us. First, this <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/02/heres-what-we-know-about-gia/" target="_blank">allegedly fake bomb threat</a> at Gia had us up in arms (ha, ha) about our salads. The very next day, a tipster noticed that Greek Lady offers <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/02/greek-lady-get-crunk/" target="_blank"><em>a shot of white wine</em></a> for 50 cents&#8211;whether or not there&#8217;s a maximum order limit is YTBD (2012, you hold so much potential).</p>
<p><strong>Generally Awesome Occurrences</strong></p>
<p><em>Introduction of the 50-Piece-McNugget&#8211; </em>While not specific to Penn&#8217;s campus, <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/01/dispatches-the-50-piece-chicken-mcnuggets/" target="_blank">this ongoing promo</a> single-handedly put McD&#8217;s on the radar for places to be seen past 3 a.m. (other contenders include FroGro and Under The Button).</p>
<p><em>1920 NOMmons (pictured above)&#8211; </em>Sure, renaming PennMed was kind of a big deal, but this? This was monumental. To whoever pulled off <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/10/far-from-common/" target="_blank">renaming the dining hall we most love-to-hate</a>: you get our NOMination for all the sexy points.</p>
<p><em>We R #1&#8211; </em>Of every food-related story we did this year (and there were a lot), 2011&#8242;s top piece of campus dining news has to be, without question, that one time Capogiro was ranked, oh, it&#8217;s nothing really, well, okay, I guess we can tell you&#8211; <a href="http://underthebutton.com/2011/11/capo-hero/" target="_blank">#1 IN THE FREAKING WORLD</a>. By <em>National Geographic</em>, no less, so it can&#8217;t be chalked up to pretentious self-promotion (we wish). Luv u, gelato bb. Luv u.</p>
