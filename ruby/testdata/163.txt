<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">Taken together the Murdoch media is a huge, huge voice in the US political conversation. But it’s an overpowering voice in intra-Republican questions. So who gets the Murdoch, Ailes and company nod, is a big big deal in a GOP primary race. Thus, the Murdoch primary.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000080;">So who won? It sort of slipped by in all the Newt craziness. But looking back over the last month we can see pretty clearly what happened. In late November <strong>the Fox at folks</strong> pretty clearly said WTF in response to the Newt surge, called it for Romney and got to work big time.</span></p>
<p>A nice example of <em>lapsus calami</em> (though I guess it should really be called <em>lapsus digitorum</em>): two phonologically-similar nouns swapping places.  Unless it's a joke that went over my head.</p>
