<p><strong>(<a href="http://www.people.com" target="_blank">PEOPLE.com</a>)</strong> -- Life has come quite close to imitating art for Debra Messing and <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20557245,00.html?cnn=yes" target="_blank">her new man</a>, "Smash" co-star Will Chase.</p>
<p>On the NBC show, which <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20553678,00.html?cnn=yes" target="_blank">premieres in February</a>, the actors play married people who are romantically entangled.</p>
<p>And in real life, their personal lives are just as complicated.</p>
<p>Messing, 43, and her husband of 10 years Daniel Zelman, separated earlier this year, <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20555299,00.html?cnn=yes" target="_blank">she recently revealed</a>. Chase, 41, is currently divorcing his stage actress wife Stephanie Gibson, after splitting this month.</p>
<p>And though an on-set source says Messing and Chase have been an item for six weeks, it took a while for people to catch on.</p>
<p>"They had so many scenes together and they were playing people with a romantic past so it didn't seem odd," says the source. "Things only really started to heat up between them several weeks ago."</p>
<p>And while Messing (who has a 7-year-old son, Roman) and Chase (who has two children from a previous marriage) clearly have plenty of logistics to work out, the source says they haven't gotten to the point of discussing their future.</p>
<p>Says the source, "This is all very, very new."</p>
