<p class="noindent">In a city of transience, few restaurants hold both our imagination and their leases for very long. Tertulia, in the West Village—a tapas bar only recently excavated from its brick foundation by the chef Seamus Mullen, formerly of Boqueria—feels like it’s been there all along. The trappings are substantial, and have the implication of a previous life in Spain. A large tarnished mirror advertising northern regional seafood specialties in euros serves as wall décor, slatted wooden banquettes trimmed with wrought iron and tile look as though they were lifted from a public square in a northwestern hamlet, and an old barrel with six functional taps adds to the Asturian-cider-house aesthetic. The wine list is accessible in two forms: hanging chalkboards or hefty slabs of slate. You’ll want to peruse it while you wait, for wait you will.</p>
<p>The menu consists of small dishes ranging from bites to bowlfuls, and the starters—meats, cheeses, toasts—sound dangerously simple enough to skip, but they should not be overlooked. The <em>pan con tomate</em> is an experience much greater than the sum of its ordinary parts: garlic-and-oil-rubbed toast, smeared with a thin layer of tomato. Dry-cured meats such as <em>cabecero</em>, <em>sobrassada</em>, and chorizo, served on thick wooden boards, afford a chance to see a manual fly-wheel Berkel slicer in action (Mullen had a vintage model custom refurbished in Italy). A take on the <em>cojonudo</em> replaces the traditional chorizo with bites of pig’s cheeks topped with quail egg on toast rounds. Its meaning falls somewhere between “brilliant” and “ballsy,” and one may feel as much having ordered it.</p>
<p>To follow, there are straightforward standards as well as imaginative twists on classic tapas. Crispy cubes of <em>patatas bravas</em>, covered in fiery <em>pimentón</em> and drizzled in aioli, are brought to the table in a small frying pan. <em>Croquetas de jamón</em>, creamy fritters filled with béchamel and chunks of <em>ibérico</em> ham, are served over an earthy quince paste. Fried <em>pimientos de padrón</em> are, true to their description, covered in “lots of sea salt”; that some are much spicier than others makes for a lively guessing game. <em>Arroz a la plancha</em>, an ingenious cross between risotto and paella, with wild mushrooms, <em>ibérico</em> ham, and snails that are foraged and then fed only basil, is creamy, crispy, and rich. Mullen, who was raised in Vermont, is a true Hispanophile, and it shows: his tortilla española is as bona fide as his Spanish accent, which is flawless. Most telling is his obsession with <em>jamón ibérico de bellota</em>, the finest and most expensive grade of Iberian ham, made from pigs fattened on acorns. Upon learning this fact, one diner noticed the nutty flavor and mused, “What would I taste like?” (Open Mondays through Fridays for lunch and dinner and weekends for brunch and dinner. Tapas $5-$23.) <span class="dingbat">♦</span></p>
