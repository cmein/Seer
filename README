Current Priority:
-Figure out how to collect a large sample of feed entries (n=5000). Currently most feeds only show latest 10 entries, how to get more entries?


Usage:
-----------------------------
Rails environment is basically setup but all the "real" code is currently in /ruby for testing.

******************
samplegetter.rb
******************

run from / in the command line with:
$ ruby ruby/samplegetter.rb

This pulls from an array of feeds from ruby/samplefeeds.txt and saves their entries' contents as .txt files to ruby/testdata


******************
textsplitter.rb
******************

run from / in the command line with:
$ ruby ruby/textsplitter.rb

Takes the .txt files created by samplegetter.rb (ruby/testdata/*.txt) and analyzes them. Prints each unique word and its frequency, mean, and standard deviation, and saves all this output to ruby/testdata.csv. Estimates which words should belong on the blacklist by z-score and outputs the list to ruby/blacklist.txt.




Unresolved Issues:
-----------------------------
-Alternate spellings & misspellings
-Acronyms
-Special characters


Future Features:
-----------------------------
-Get full posts from feeds that only show summaries (like: http://fulltextrssfeed.com/ & http://www.wizardrss.com/)
